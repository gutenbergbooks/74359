  <h2 class='c006'>ADVERTISEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Twenty years have now elapsed since the
first Edition of this Book made its appearance.
During this period, the Author, having been
in constant practice, has taken occasion to improve
several articles, which were with less accuracy inserted
in the more early impressions. For this he has
been censured by some, but the more candid and
discerning must approve his conduct. It would be
unpardonable in an Author to suffer an error in a
book, on which health and life may depend, to
stand uncorrected; nor would it be much less so to
perceive an omission, and leave it unsupplied. His
improvements, however, are not the result of mercenary
views. The same principle which prompted
the Author to write the Book, will ever induce him
to improve it to the utmost of his power.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Author has indeed to regret, that the limits
of one volume preclude many interesting observations,
and likewise deprive him of the pleasure of
inserting a number of very useful remarks made by
his learned and ingenious friend Doctor <span class='sc'>Duplanil</span>,
of Paris, who has done him the honour of publishing
an elegant translation of this Work, in five
volumes octavo, accompanied with an excellent
commentary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The improvements of the later editions are
chiefly inserted in the form of notes. These are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>intended either to illustrate the text, or to put people
on their guard in dangerous situations, and
prevent fatal mistakes in the practice of medicine,
which it is to be regretted are but too common.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some attention has likewise been paid to the
language. Where that was either inaccurate or
obscure, as far as was practicable, it has been corrected.
Indeed, the Author has all along endeavoured
to observe such simplicity and perspicuity
in his style as might enable the reader clearly to
understand it: a circumstance of the utmost importance
in a performance of this nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although the <span class='sc'>Domestic Medicine</span> was never
intended to supercede the use of a physician, but
to supply his place in situations where medical assistance
could not easily be obtained; yet the Author
is sorry to observe, that the jealousies and fears
of the Faculty have prompted many of them to treat
this Work in a manner altogether unbecoming the
professors of a liberal science: notwithstanding
their injurious treatment, he is determined to persist
in his plan, being fully convinced of its utility;
nor shall interest or prejudice ever deter him from
exerting his best endeavours <i>to render the Medical
Art more extensively beneficial to</i> <span class='sc'>Mankind</span>.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this illiberal treatment of the Faculty is not
the only thing of which the Author has cause to
complain. By some of them his Book has been
served up mangled and mutilated, and its title,
type, size, &#38;c. so closely imitated, that purchasers
are misled, and frequently buy these spurious productions
instead of the real one. That a needy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>Author, incapable himself of producing an original
work, should prey upon another, and that a mercenary
Bookseller should vend such productions,
knowing them to be stolen, are things not at all to
be wondered at: but that all this can be done with
impunity, shews that the laws of this country respecting
literary property, are still in a very imperfect
state, and stand much in need of amendment.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When I first signified my intention of publishing
the following sheets, I was told by
my friends it would draw on me the resentment of
the whole Faculty. As I never could entertain
such an unfavourable idea, I was resolved to make
the experiment, which indeed came out pretty
much as might have been expected. Many whose
learning and liberality of sentiments do honour to
medicine received the book in a manner which at
once shewed their indulgence, and the falsity of the
opinion <i>that every physician wishes to conceal his art</i>;
while the more selfish and narrow-minded, generally
the most numerous in every profession, have
not failed to persecute both the book and its author.</p>

<p class='c008'>The reception, however, which this work has
met with from the Public merits my most grateful
acknowledgments. As the best way of expressing
these, I have endeavoured to render it more generally
useful, by enlarging the <i>prophylaxis</i>, or that
part which treats of preventing diseases; and by
adding many articles which had been entirely omitted
in the former impressions. It is needless to
enumerate these additions; I shall only say, that I
hope they will be found real improvements.</p>

<p class='c008'>The observations relative to Nursing and the Management
of Children, were chiefly suggested by an
extensive practice among infants, in a large branch
of the Foundling Hospital, where I had an opportunity
not only of treating the diseases incident to
childhood, but likewise of trying different plans of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>nursing, and observing their effects. Whenever I
had it in my power to place the children under the
care of proper nurses, to instruct these nurses in
their duty, and to be satisfied that they performed
it, very few of them died; but when, from distance
of place, and other unavoidable circumstances, the
children were left to the sole care of mercenary
nurses, without any person to instruct or superintend
them, scarce any of them lived.</p>

<p class='c008'>This was so apparent, as with me to amount to
a proof of the following melancholy fact: <i>That almost
one half of the human species perish in infancy, by
improper management or neglect</i>. This reflection has
made me often wish to be the happy instrument of
alleviating the miseries of those suffering innocents,
or of rescuing them from an untimely grave. No
one, who has not had an opportunity of observing
them, can imagine what absurd and ridiculous
practices still prevail in the nursing and management
of infants, and what numbers of lives are by that
means lost to society. As these practices are chiefly
owing to ignorance, it is to be hoped, that when
nurses are better informed, their conduct will be
more proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The application of medicine to the various occupations
of life has been in general the result of
observation. An extensive practice for several years,
in one of the largest manufacturing towns in England,
afforded me sufficient opportunities of observing
the injuries which those useful people sustain
from their particular employments, and likewise of
trying various methods of obviating such injuries.
The success which attended these trials was sufficient
to encourage this attempt, which I hope will
be of use to those who are under the necessity of
earning their bread by such employments as are
unfavourable to health.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>I do not mean to intimidate men, far less to insinuate
that even those arts, the practice of which
is attended with some degree of danger, should not
be carried on; but to guard the less cautious and
unwary against those dangers which they have it in
their power to avoid, and which they often, through
mere ignorance, incur. As every occupation in
life disposes those who follow it to some particular
diseases more than to others, it is certainly of importance
to know these, in order that people may
be upon their guard against them. It is always
better to be warned of the approach of an enemy,
than to be surprised by him, especially where there
is a possibility of avoiding the danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The observations concerning Diet, Air, Exercise,
&#38;c. are of a more general nature, and have not
escaped the attention of physicians in any age.
They are subjects of too great importance, however,
to be passed over in an attempt of this kind,
and can never be sufficiently recommended. The
man who pays a proper attention to these, will seldom
need the physician; and he who does not, will
seldom enjoy health, let him employ as many physicians
as he pleases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though we have endeavoured to point out the
causes of diseases, and to put people upon their
guard against them, yet it must be acknowledged
that they are often of such a nature as to admit of
being removed only by the diligence and activity
of the public magistrate. We are sorry, indeed,
to observe, that the power of the magistrate is seldom
exerted in this country for the preservation of
health. The importance of a proper medical police
is either not understood, or little regarded.
Many things highly injurious to the public health
are daily practiced with impunity, while others,
absolutely necessary for its preservation, are entirely
neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>Some of the public means of preserving health
are mentioned in the general prophylaxis, as the
inspection of provisions, widening the streets of
great towns, keeping them clean, supplying the
inhabitants with wholesome water, &#38;c.; but they
are passed over in a very cursory manner. A proper
attention to these would have swelled this volume
to too large a size; I have therefore reserved
them for the subject of a future publication.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the treatment of diseases, I have been peculiarly
attentive to regimen. The generality of
people lay too much stress upon Medicine, and
trust too little to their own endeavours. It is always
in the power of the patient, or of those
about him, to do as much towards his recovery as
can be effected by the physician. By not attending
to this, the designs of Medicine are often frustrated;
and the patient, by pursuing a wrong plan
of regimen, not only defeats the Doctor’s endeavours,
but renders them dangerous. I have often
known patients killed by an error in regimen, when
they were using very proper medicines. It will be
said, the physician always orders the regimen when
he prescribes a medicine. I wish it were so, both
for the honour of the Faculty and the safety of
their patients: but physicians, as well as other people,
are too little attentive to this matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though many reckon it doubtful whether physic
is more beneficial or hurtful to mankind,
yet all allow the necessity and importance of a proper
regimen in diseases. Indeed the very appetites
of the sick prove its propriety. No man in
his senses ever imagined that a person in a fever,
for example, could eat, drink, or conduct himself
in the same manner as one in perfect health. This
part of medicine, therefore, is evidently founded
in Nature, and is every way consistent with reason
and common sense. Had men been more attentive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiii'>xiii</span>to it, and less solicitous in hunting after secret
remedies, Medicine had never become an object
of ridicule.</p>

<p class='c008'>This seems to have been the first idea of Medicine.
The ancient physicians acted chiefly in
the capacity of nurses. They went very little beyond
aliment in their prescriptions; and even this
they generally administered themselves, attending
the sick for that purpose through the whole course
of the disease; which gave them an opportunity
not only of marking the changes of diseases with
great accuracy, but likewise of observing the effects
of their different applications, and adapting
them to the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The learned Dr. Arbuthnot asserts, that by a
proper attention to those things which are almost
within the reach of every body, more good and less
mischief will be done in acute diseases, than by
medicines improperly and unseasonably administered;
and that great cures may be effected in chronical
distempers, by a proper regimen of the diet
only. So entirely do the Doctor’s sentiments and
mine agree, that I would advise every person, ignorant
of physic, to confine his practice solely to
diet, and the other parts of regimen; by which
means he may often do much good, and can seldom
do any hurt.</p>

<p class='c008'>This seems also to have been the opinion of the
ingenious Dr. Huxham, who observes, that we often
seek from Art what all-bountiful Nature most readily,
and as effectually, offers us, had we diligence
and sagacity enough to observe and make use of
them; that the <i>dietetic</i> part of Medicine is not so
much studied as it ought to be; and that, though
less pompous, yet it is the most natural method of
curing diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>To render the book more generally useful, however,
as well as more acceptable to the intelligent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xiv'>xiv</span>part of mankind, I have in most diseases, besides
regimen, recommended some of the most simple
and approved forms of medicine, and added such
cautions and directions as seemed necessary for their
safe administration, it would no doubt have been
more acceptable to many, had it abounded with
pompous prescriptions, and promised great cures
in consequence of their use; but this was not my
plan: I think the administration of medicines always
doubtful, and often dangerous, and would
much rather teach men how to avoid the necessity
of using them, than how they should be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several medicines, and those of considerable efficacy,
may be administered with great freedom and
safety. Physicians generally trifle a long time
with medicines before they learn their proper use.
Many peasants at present know better how to use
some of the most important articles in the <i>materia
medica</i>, than physicians did a century ago; and
doubtless the same observation will hold with regard
to others some time hence. Wherever I was convinced
that medicine might be used with safety, or
where the cure depended chiefly upon it, I have
taken care to recommend it; but where it was
either highly dangerous, or not very necessary, it
is omitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have not troubled the reader with an useless
parade of quotations from different authors, but
have in general adopted their observations where
my own were either defective, or totally wanting.
Those to whom I am most obliged are, Ramazini,
Arbuthnot, and Tissot; the last of which, in his
<cite><span lang="fr">Avis au Peuple</span></cite>, comes the nearest to my views of
any author which I have seen. Had the Doctor’s
plan been as complete as the execution is masterly,
we should have had no occasion for any new treatise
of this kind soon; but by confining himself to
the acute diseases, he has in my opinion omitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xv'>xv</span>the most useful part of his subject. People in acute
diseases may sometimes be their own physicians;
but in the chronic, the cure must ever depend
chiefly upon the patient’s own endeavours. The
Doctor has also passed over the <i>Prophylaxis</i>, or preventive
part of Medicine, very slightly, though it
is certainly of the greatest importance in such a
work. He had no doubt his reasons for so doing,
and I am so far from finding fault with him, that I
think his performance does great honour both to his
head and to his heart.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several other foreign physicians of eminence
have written on nearly the same plan with Tissot, as
the Baron Van Swieten, physician to their Imperial
Majesties, M. Rosen, first physician of the kingdom
of Sweden, &#38;c.; but these gentlemen’s productions
have never come to my hand. I cannot
help wishing, however, that some of our distinguished
countrymen would follow their example.
There still remains much to be done on this subject,
and it does not appear to me how any man could
better employ his time or talents, than in eradicating
hurtful prejudices, and diffusing useful knowledge
among the people.</p>

<p class='c008'>I know some of the Faculty disapprove of every
attempt of this nature, imagining that it must totally
destroy their influence. But this notion appears to
me to be as absurd as it is illiberal. People in distress
will always apply for relief to men of superior
abilities, when they have it in their power; and
they will do this with far greater confidence and
readiness when they believe that Medicine is a rational
science, than when they take it to be only a
matter of mere conjecture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though I have endeavoured to render this Treatise
plain and useful, yet I found it impossible to
avoid some terms of art; but those are in general
either explained, or are such as most people understand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvi'>xvi</span>In short, I have endeavoured to conform
my style to the capacities of mankind in general;
and, if my Readers do not flatter either themselves
or me, with some degree of success. On a medical
subject, this is not so easy a matter as some
may imagine. To make a shew of learning is
easier than to write plain sense, especially in a science
which has been kept at such a distance from
common observation. It would however be no
difficult matter to prove, that every thing valuable
in the practical part of Medicine is within the reach
of common abilities.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be ungenerous not to express my warmest
acknowledgments to those Gentlemen who have
endeavoured to extend the usefulness of this Performance,
by translating it into the language of
their respective countries. Most of them have not
only given elegant translations of the Book, but
have also enriched it with many useful observations;
by which it is rendered more complete,
and better adapted to the climate and the constitutions
of their countrymen. To the learned Dr.
Duplanil of Paris, physician to the Count d’Artois,
I lie under particular obligations; as this Gentleman
has not only considerably enlarged my Treatise,
but, by his very ingenious and useful notes,
has rendered it so popular on the Continent, as to
occasion its being translated into all the languages
of modern Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have only to add, that the book has not more
exceeded my expectations in its success, than in the
effects it has produced. Some of the most pernicious
practices, with regard to the treatment of the
sick, have already given place to a more rational
conduct; and many of the most hurtful prejudices,
which seemed to be quite insurmountable, have in
a great measure yielded to better information. Of
this a stronger instance cannot be given than the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xvii'>xvii</span>inoculation of the small-pox. Few mothers, some
years ago, would submit to have their children
inoculated even by the hand of a Physician; yet
nothing is more certain, than that of late many of
them have performed this operation with their own
hands; and as their success has been equal to that
of the most dignified inoculators, there is little reason
to doubt that the practice will become general.
Whenever this shall be the case, more lives will be
saved by inoculation alone, than are at present by
all the endeavours of the Faculty.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>INTRODUCTION.</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The improvements in Medicine, since the revival
of learning, have by no means kept
pace with those of the other arts. The reason is
obvious. Medicine has been studied by few, except
those who intended to live by it as a trade.
Such, either from a mistaken zeal for the honour
of Medicine, or to raise their own importance, have
endeavoured to disguise and conceal the art. Medical
authors have generally written in a foreign
language; and those who were unequal to this talk,
have even valued themselves upon couching, at
least, their prescriptions, in terms and characters
unintelligible to the rest of mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The contentions of the clergy, which happened
soon after the restoration of learning, engaged the
attention of mankind, and paved the way for that
freedom of thought and inquiry, which has since
prevailed in most parts of Europe with regard to
religious matters. Every man took a side in those
bloody disputes; and every gentleman, that he
might distinguish himself on one side or other, was
instructed in Divinity. This taught people to think
and reason for themselves in matters of religion,
and at last totally destroyed that complete and absolute
dominion which the clergy had obtained over
the minds of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>The study of Law has likewise, in most civilized
nations, been justly deemed a necessary part of the
education of a gentleman. Every gentleman ought
certainly to know at least the laws of his own country:
and, if he were also acquainted with those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xx'>xx</span>others, it might be more than barely an ornament
to him.</p>

<p class='c008'>The different branches of Philosophy have also
of late been very universally studied by all who
pretended to a liberal education. The advantages
of this are manifest. It frees the mind from prejudice
and superstition; fits it for the investigation
of truth; induces habits of reasoning and judging
properly; opens an inexhaustible source of entertainment;
paves the way to the improvement of
arts and agriculture; and qualifies men for acting
with propriety in the most important stations of
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Natural History is likewise become an object of
general attention; and it well deserves to be so.
It leads to discoveries of the greatest importance.
Indeed agriculture, the most useful of all arts, is
only a branch of Natural History, and can never
arrive at a high degree of improvement where the
study of that science is neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicine however has not, as far as I know,
in any country, been reckoned a necessary part of
the education of a gentleman. But surely no sufficient
reason can be assigned for this omission. No
science lays open a more extensive field of useful
knowledge, or affords more ample entertainment
to an inquisitive mind. Anatomy, Botany, Chymistry,
and the <i>Materia Medica</i>, are all branches
of Natural History, and are fraught with such
amusement and utility, that the man who entirely
neglects them has but a sorry claim either to taste
or learning. If a gentleman has a turn for observation,
says an excellent and sensible writer<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c010'><sup>[1]</sup></a>,
surely the natural history of his own species is a
more interesting subject, and presents a more ample
field for the exertion of genius, than the natural
history of spiders and cockle-shells.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxi'>xxi</span>We do not mean that every man should become
a physician. This would be an attempt as ridiculous
as it is impossible. All we plead for is, that
men of sense and learning should be so far acquainted
with the general principles of Medicine, as to
be in a condition to derive from it some of those
advantages with which it is fraught; and at the
same time to guard themselves against the destructive
influences of Ignorance, Superstition, and
Quackery.</p>

<p class='c008'>As matters stand at present, it is easier to cheat
a man out of his life than of a shilling, and almost
impossible either to detect or punish the offender.
Notwithstanding this, people still shut their eyes,
and take every thing upon trust that is administered
by any Pretender to Medicine, without daring
to ask him a reason for any part of his conduct.
Implicit faith, every where else the object of ridicule,
is still sacred here. Many of the faculty are
no doubt worthy of all the confidence that can be
reposed in them; but as this can never be the
character of every individual in any profession, it
would certainly be for the safety, as well as the honour,
of mankind, to have some check upon the
conduct of those to whom they entrust so valuable
a treasure as health.</p>

<p class='c008'>The veil of mystery, which still hangs over medicine,
renders it not only a conjectural, but even
a suspicious art. This has been long ago removed
from the other sciences, which induces many to
believe that Medicine is a mere trick, and that it
will not bear a fair and candid examination. Medicine,
however, needs only to be better known,
in order to secure the general esteem of mankind.
Its precepts are such as every wise man would chuse
to observe, and it forbids nothing but what is incompatible
with true happiness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxii'>xxii</span>Disguising Medicine not only retards its improvement
as a science, but exposes the profession
to ridicule, and is injurious to the true interests of
society. An art founded on observation never can
arrive at any high degree of improvement, while
it is confined to a few who make a trade of it.
The united observations of all the ingenious and
sensible part of mankind, would do more in a few
years towards the improvement of Medicine, than
those of the Faculty alone in a great many. Any
man can tell when a medicine gives him ease as
well as a physician; and if he only knows the
name and dose of the medicine, and the name of
the disease, it is sufficient to perpetuate the fact.
Yet the man who adds one single fact to the stock
of medical observations, does more real service to
the art, than he who writes a volume in support of
some favourable hypothesis.</p>

<p class='c008'>Very few of the valuable discoveries in Medicine
have been made by physicians. They have in
general either been the effect of chance or of necessity,
and have been usually opposed by the Faculty,
till every one else was convinced of their importance.
An implicit faith in the opinions of teachers,
an attachment to systems and established forms,
and the dread of reflections, will always operate
upon those who follow Medicine as a trade. Few
improvements are to be expected from a man who
might ruin his character and family by even the
smallest deviation from an established rule.</p>

<p class='c008'>If men of letters, says the author of the performance
quoted above, were to claim their right
of inquiry into a matter that so nearly concerns
them, the good effects on Medicine would soon
appear. Such men would have no separate interest
from that of the art. They would detect and expose
assuming Ignorance under the mask of Gravity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiii'>xxiii</span>and Importance, and would be the judges and patrons
of modest merit. Not having their understandings
perverted in their youth by false theories,
unawed by authority, and unbiassed by interest,
they would canvass with freedom the most universally
received principles in Medicine, and expose
the uncertainty of many of those doctrines, of
which a physician dares not so much as seem to
doubt.</p>

<p class='c008'>No argument, continues he, can be brought
against laying open Medicine, which does not apply
with equal, if not greater force, to religion;
yet experience has shewn, that since the laity have
asserted their right of inquiry into these subjects,
Theology, considered as a science, has been improved,
the interests of real religion have been
promoted, and the clergy have become a more
learned, a more useful, and a more respectable
body of men, than they ever were in the days of
their greatest power and splendour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Had other medical writers been as honest as this
gentleman, the art had been upon a very different
footing at this day. Most of them extol the merit
of those men who brought Philosophy out of the
schools, and subjected it to the rules of common
sense. But they never consider that Medicine, at
present, is in nearly the same situation as Philosophy
was at that time, and that it might be as much
improved by being treated in the same manner.
Indeed, no science can either be rendered rational
or useful, without being submitted to the common
sense and reason of mankind. These alone stamp
a value upon science; and what will not bear the
test of these ought to be rejected.</p>

<p class='c008'>I know it will be said, that diffusing medical
knowledge among the people might induce them
to tamper with Medicine, and to trust to their own
skill instead of calling a physician. The reverse of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxiv'>xxiv</span>this however is true. Persons who have most
knowledge in these matters, are commonly most
ready both to ask and to follow advice, when it is
necessary. The ignorant are always most apt to
tamper with Medicine, and have the least confidence
in physicians. Instances of this are daily to
be met with among the ignorant peasants, who,
while they absolutely refuse to take a medicine
which has been prescribed by a physician, will swallow
with greediness any thing that is recommended
to them by their credulous neighbours. Where
men will act even without knowledge, it is certainly
more rational to afford them all the light
we can, than to leave them entirely in the dark.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may also be alleged, that laying Medicine
more open to mankind would lessen their faith in
it. This would indeed be the case with regard to
some; but it would have a quite contrary effect
upon others. I know many people who have the
utmost dread and horror of every thing prescribed
by a physician, but who will nevertheless very
readily take a medicine which they know, and
whose qualities they are in some measure acquainted
with. Hence it is evident, that the dread arises
from the doctor, not from the drug. Nothing
ever can or will inspire mankind with an absolute
confidence in physicians, but an open, frank, and
undisguised behaviour. While the least shadow of
mystery remains in the conduct of the Faculty,
doubts, jealousies, and suspicions, will arise in the
minds of men.</p>

<p class='c008'>No doubt cases will sometimes occur, where a
prudent physician may find it expedient to disguise
a medicine. The whims and humours of men
must be regarded by those who mean to do them
service; but this can never affect the general argument
in favour of candour and openness. A
man might as well allege, because there are knaves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxv'>xxv</span>and fools in the world, that he ought to take every
one he meets for such, and to treat him accordingly.
A sensible physician will always know where
disguise is necessary; but it ought never to appear
on the face of his general conduct.</p>

<p class='c008'>The appearance of mystery in the conduct of
physicians not only renders their art suspicious, but
lays the foundations of Quackery, which is the
disgrace of Medicine. No two characters can be
more different than that of the honest physician and
the quack; yet they have generally been very much
confounded. The line between them is not sufficiently
apparent; at least it is too fine for the general
eye. Few persons are able to distinguish sufficiently
between the conduct of that man who administers
a secret medicine, and him who writes
a prescription in mystical characters and an unknown
tongue. Thus the conduct of the honest
physician, which needs no disguise, gives a sanction
to that of the villain, whose sole consequence
depends upon secrecy.</p>

<p class='c008'>No laws will ever be able to prevent quackery,
while people believe that the quack is as honest a
man, and as well qualified, as the physician. A
very small degree of medical knowledge, however,
would be sufficient to break this spell; and nothing
else can effectually undeceive them. It is the ignorance
and credulity of the multitude, with regard
to medicine, which renders them such an easy prey
to every one who has the hardiness to attack them
on this quarter. Nor can the evil be remedied by
any other means but by making them wiser.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most effectual way to destroy quackery in
any art or science, is to diffuse the knowledge of it
among mankind. Did physicians write their prescriptions
in the common language of the country,
and explain their intentions to the patient, as far as
he could understand them, it would enable him to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvi'>xxvi</span>know when the medicine had the desired effect;
would inspire him with absolute confidence in the
physician; and would make him dread and detest
every man who pretended to cram a secret medicine
down his throat.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men in the different states of society, have very
different views of the same object. Some time ago
it was the practice of this country for every person to
say his prayers in Latin, whether he knew any thing
of that language or not. This conduct, though sacred
in the eyes of our ancestors, appears ridiculous
enough to us; and doubtless some parts of ours will
seem as strange to posterity. Among these we may
reckon the present mode of medical prescription,
which, we venture to affirm, will sometime hence appear
to have been completely ridiculous, and a very
high burlesque upon the common sense of mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this practice is not only ridiculous, it is likewise
dangerous. However capable physicians may
be of writing Latin, I am certain apothecaries are not
always in a condition to read it, and that dangerous
mistakes, in consequence of this, often happen. But
suppose the apothecary ever so able to read the physician’s
prescription, he is generally otherwise employed,
and the business of making up prescriptions
is left entirely to the apprentice. By this means the
greatest man in the kingdom, even when he employs
a first-rate physician, in reality trusts his life in the
hands of an idle boy, who has not only the chance
of being very ignorant, but likewise giddy and careless.
Mistakes will sometimes happen in spite of
the greatest care; but, where human lives are concerned,
all possible methods ought certainly to be
taken to prevent them. For this reason, the prescriptions
of physicians, instead of being couched
in mystical characters and a foreign language,
ought, in my humble opinion, to be conceived in
the most plain and obvious terms imaginable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_xxvii'>xxvii</span>Diffusing medical knowledge among the people
would not only tend to improve the art, and to banish
quackery, but likewise to render Medicine more universally
useful, by extending its benefits to society.
However long Medicine may have been known as a
science, we will venture to say, that many of its most
important purposes to society have either been overlooked,
or very little attended to. The cure of diseases
is doubtless a matter of great importance; but the
preservation of health is of still greater. This is the
concern of every man, and surely what relates to it
ought to be rendered as plain and obvious to all as
possible. It is not to be supposed, that men can be
sufficiently upon their guard against diseases, who
are totally ignorant of their causes. Neither can
the legislature, in whose power it is to do much
more for preserving the public health than can ever
be done by the Faculty, exert that power with
propriety, and to the greatest advantage, without
some degree of medical knowledge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men of every occupation and condition in life
might avail themselves of a degree of medical
knowledge; as it would teach them to avoid the
dangers peculiar to their respective stations; which
is always easier than to remove their effects. Medical
knowledge, instead of being a check upon
the enjoyments of life, only teaches men how to
make the most of them. It has indeed been said,
<i>that to live medically is to live miserably</i>: but it
might with equal propriety be said, that to live rationally
is to live miserably. If physicians obtrude
their own ridiculous whims upon mankind,
or lay down rules inconsistent with reason or common
sense, no doubt they will be despised. But
this is not the fault of Medicine. It proposes no
rules that I know, but such as are perfectly consistent
with the true enjoyment of life, and every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxviii'>xxviii</span>way conducive to the real happiness of mankind.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are sorry indeed to observe, that Medicine
has hitherto hardly been considered as a popular
science, but as a branch of knowledge solely confined
to a particular set of men, while all the rest
have been taught not only to neglect, but even to
dread and despise it. It will however appear, upon
a more strict examination, that no science better
deserves their attention, or is more capable of
being rendered generally useful.</p>

<p class='c008'>People are told, that if they dip the least into
medical knowledge, it will render them fanciful,
and make them believe they have every disease
of which they read. This I am satisfied will
seldom be the case with sensible people; and, suppose
it were, they must soon be undeceived. A
short time will shew them their error, and a little
more reading will infallibly correct it. A single
instance will shew the absurdity of this notion. A
sensible lady, rather than read a medical performance,
which would instruct her in the management
of her children, must leave them entirely to the
care and conduct of the most ignorant, credulous,
and superstitious part of the human species.</p>

<p class='c008'>No part of Medicine is of more general importance
than that which relates to the nursing
and management of children. Yet few parents
pay a proper attention to it. They leave the sole
care of their tender offspring, at the very time
when care and attention are most necessary, to hirelings,
who are either too careless to do their duty,
or too ignorant to know it. We will venture to
affirm, that more human lives are lost by the carelessness
and inattention of parents and nurses, than
are saved by the Faculty; and that the joint and
well-conducted endeavours, both of private persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxix'>xxix</span>and the public, for the preservation of infant
lives, would be of more advantage to society, than
the whole art of Medicine, upon its present footing.</p>

<p class='c008'>The benefits of Medicine, as a trade, will ever
be confined to those who are able to pay for them;
and of course, the far greater part of mankind will
be every where deprived of them. Physicians, like
other people, must live by their employment, and
the poor must either want advice altogether, or
take up with that which is worse than none. There
are not however any where wanting well-disposed
people, of better sense, who are willing to supply
the defect of medical advice to the poor, did not
their fear of doing ill often suppress their inclination
to do good. Such people are often deterred from
the most noble and praise-worthy actions, by the
foolish alarms sounded in their ears by a set of men
who, to raise their own importance, magnify the
difficulties of doing good, find fault with what is
truly commendable, and fleer at every attempt to
relieve the sick which is not conducted by the
precise rules of Medicine. These gentlemen must
however excuse me for saying, that I have often
known such well-disposed persons do much good;
and that their practice, which is generally the
result of good sense and observation, assisted by
a little medical reading, is frequently more rational
than that of the ignorant retainer to physic,
who despises both reason and observation, <i>that he
may go wrong by rule</i>; and who, while he is dosing
his patient with medicines, often neglects other
things of far greater importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many things are necessary for the sick besides
medicine. Nor is the person who takes care to
procure those for them, of less importance than a
physician. The poor oftener perish in diseases for
want of proper nursing than of medicine. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxx'>xxx</span>are frequently in want of even the necessaries of
life, and still more so of what is proper for a sickbed.
No one can imagine, who has not been a
witness of these situations, how much good a well-disposed
person may do, by only taking care to
have such wants supplied. There certainly cannot
be a more necessary, a more noble, or a more godlike
action, than to administer to the wants of our
fellow-creatures in distress. While virtue or religion
are known among mankind, this conduct
will be approved; and while Heaven is just, it
must be rewarded!</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who do not chuse to administer medicine
to the sick, may nevertheless direct their regimen.
An eminent medical author has said,
That by diet alone all the intentions of Medicine
may be answered<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c010'><sup>[2]</sup></a>. No doubt a great many of them
may; but there are other things beside diet, which
ought by no means to be neglected. Many hurtful
and destructive prejudices, with regard to the
treatment of the sick, still prevail among the people,
which persons of better sense and learning
alone can eradicate. To guard the poor against
the influence of these prejudices, and to instil into
their minds some just ideas of the importance of
proper food, fresh air, cleanliness, and other pieces
of regimen necessary in diseases, would be a work
of great merit, and productive of many happy
consequences. A proper regimen, in most diseases,
is at least equal to medicine, and in many of them
it is greatly superior.</p>

<p class='c008'>To assist the well-meant endeavours of the humane
and benevolent in relieving distress; to eradicate
dangerous and hurtful prejudices; to guard
the ignorant and credulous against the frauds and
impositions of quacks and impostors; and to shew
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xxxi'>xxxi</span>men what is in their own power, both with regard
to the prevention and cure of diseases, are certainly
objects worthy of the physician’s attention. These
were the leading views in composing and publishing
the following sheets. They were suggested by
an attention to the conduct of mankind, with regard
to Medicine, in the course of a pretty long
practice in different parts of this island, during
which the author has often had occasion to wish
that his patients, or those about them, had been
possessed of some such plain directory for regulating
their conduct. How far he has succeeded
in his endeavours to supply this deficiency, must
be left for others to determine; but if they be
found to contribute in any measure towards alleviating
the calamities of mankind, he will think
his labour very well bestowed.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PART I.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE<br> GENERAL CAUSES OF DISEASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c016'>CHAP. I.<br> <span class='c015'>OF CHILDREN.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The better to trace diseases from their original
causes, we shall take a view of the common
treatment of mankind in the state of infancy. In
this period of our lives, the foundations of a good
or bad constitution are generally laid; it is therefore
of importance, that parents be well acquainted with
the various causes which may injure the health of
their offspring.</p>

<p class='c008'>It appears from the annual registers of the dead,
that almost one half of the children born in Great
Britain die under twelve years of age. To many,
indeed, this may appear a natural evil; but, on due
examination, it will be found to be one of our own
creating. Were the death of infants a natural evil,
other animals would be as liable to die young as man;
but this we find is by no means the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may seem strange that man, notwithstanding
his superior reason, should fall so far short of other
animals in the management of his young: But our
surprise will soon cease, if we consider that brutes,
guided by instinct, never err in this respect; while
man, trusting solely to art, is seldom right. Were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>a catalogue of those infants who perish annually by
art alone exhibited to public view, it would astonish
most people.</p>

<p class='c008'>If parents are above taking care of their children,
others must be employed for that purpose: these
will always endeavour to recommend themselves by
the appearance of extraordinary skill and address.
By this means such a number of unnecessary and destructive
articles have been introduced into the diet,
clothing, &#38;c. of infants, that it is no wonder so
many of them perish.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing can be more preposterous than a mother
who thinks it below her to take care of her own
child, or who is so ignorant as not to know what
is proper to be done for it. If we search Nature
throughout, we cannot find a parallel to this. Every
other animal is the nurse of its own offspring, and
they thrive accordingly. Were the brutes to bring
up their young by proxy, they would share the same
fate with those of the human species.</p>

<p class='c008'>We mean not, however, to impose it as a task
upon every mother to suckle her own child. This,
whatever speculative writers may allege, is in some
cases impracticable, and would inevitably prove destructive
both to the mother and child. Women of
delicate constitutions, subject to hysteric fits, or other
nervous affections, make very bad nurses: and these
complaints are now so common, that it is rare to find
a woman of fashion free from them; such women,
therefore, supposing them willing, are often unable
to suckle their own children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost every mother would be in a condition to
give suck, did mankind live agreeably to Nature:
but whoever considers how far many mothers deviate
from her dictates, will not be surprised to find some
of them unable to perform that necessary office.
Mothers who do not eat a sufficient quantity of solid
food, nor enjoy the benefit of free air and exercise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>can neither have wholesome juices themselves, nor
afford proper nourishment to an infant. Hence children
who are suckled by delicate women, either die
young, or continue weak and sickly all their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we say that mothers are not always in a
condition to suckle their own children, we would not
be understood as discouraging that practice. Every
mother who can, ought certainly to perform so tender
and agreeable an office<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c010'><sup>[3]</sup></a>. But, suppose it to be out
of her power, she may, nevertheless, be of great
service to her child. The business of nursing is by
no means confined to giving suck. To a woman
who abounds with milk, this is the easiest part of it.
Numberless other offices are necessary for a child,
which the mother ought at least to see done.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mother who abandons the fruit of her womb,
as soon as it is born, to the sole care of an hireling,
hardly deserves that name. A child, by being
brought up under the mother’s eye, not only secures
her affection, but may reap all the advantages of a
parent’s care, though it be suckled by another.
How can a mother be better employed than in superintending
the nursery? This is at once the most
delightful and important office; yet the most trivial
business or insipid amusements are often preferred to
it! A strong proof both of the bad taste and wrong
education of modern females.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>It is indeed to be regretted, that more care is not
bestowed in teaching the proper management of children
to those whom Nature has designed for mothers.
This, instead of being made the principal, is seldom
considered as any part of female education. Is it
any wonder, when females so educated come to be
mothers, that they should be quite ignorant of the
duties belonging to that character? However strange
it may appear, it is certainly true, that many mothers,
and those of fashion too, are as ignorant, when they
have brought a child into the world, of what is to be
done for it, as the infant itself. Indeed, the most ignorant
of the sex are generally reckoned most knowing
in the business of nursing. Hence, sensible people become
the dupes of ignorance and superstition; and
the nursing of children, instead of being conducted
by reason, is the result of whim and caprice<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c010'><sup>[4]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Were the time that is generally spent by females in
the acquisition of trifling accomplishments, employed
in learning how to bring up their children; how to
dress them so as not to hurt, cramp, or confine their
motions; how to feed them with wholesome and
nourishing food; how to exercise their tender bodies,
so as best to promote their growth and strength:
were these made the objects of female instruction,
mankind would derive the greatest advantages from
it. But while the education of females implies little
more than what relates to dress and public shew, we
have nothing to expect from them but ignorance
even in the most important concerns.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>Did mothers reflect on their own importance, and
lay it to heart, they would embrace every opportunity
of informing themselves of the duties which they owe
to their infant offspring. It is their province, not
only to form the body, but also to give the mind
its most early bias. They have it very much in
their power to make men healthy or valetudinary,
useful in life, or the pests of society.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the mother is not the only person concerned
in the management of children. The father has an
equal interest in their welfare, and ought to assist in
every thing that respects either the improvement of
the body or mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is pity that the men should be so inattentive to
this matter. Their negligence is one reason why
females know so little of it. Women will ever be
desirous to excel in such accomplishments as recommend
them to the other sex. But men generally keep
at such a distance from even the smallest acquaintance
with the affairs of the nursery, that many would
reckon it an affront, were they supposed to know
any thing of them. Not so, however, with the kennel
or the stables: a gentleman of the first rank is
not ashamed to give directions concerning the management
of his dogs or horses, yet would blush were
he surprised in performing the same office for that
being who derived its exigence from himself, who
is the heir of his fortunes, and the future hope of his
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor have physicians themselves been sufficiently
attentive to the management of children: this
has been generally considered as the sole province
of old women, while men of the first character in
physic have refused to visit infants even when sick.
Such conduct in the faculty has not only caused
this branch of medicine to be neglected, but has also
encouraged the other sex to assume an absolute title
to prescribe for children in the most dangerous diseases.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>The consequence is, that a physician is seldom
called till the good women have exhausted all their
skill; when his attendance can only serve to divide
the blame, and appease the disconsolate parents.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurses should do all in their power to prevent
diseases; but when a child is taken ill, some person
of skill ought immediately to be consulted. The
diseases of children are generally acute, and the
least delay is dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Were physicians more attentive to the diseases of
infants, they would not only be better qualified to
treat them properly when sick, but likewise to give
useful directions for their management when well.
The diseases of children are by no means so difficult
to be understood as many imagine. It is true,
children cannot tell their complaints; but the causes
of them may be pretty certainly discovered by observing
the symptoms, and putting proper questions to
the nurses. Besides, the diseases of infants being less
complicated, are easier cured than those of adults<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c010'><sup>[5]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is really astonishing, that so little attention
should in general be paid to the preservation of infants.
What labour and expence are daily bestowed
to prop an old tottering carcase for a few years,
while thousands of those who might be useful in life,
perish without being regarded! Mankind are too apt
to value things according to their present, not their
future, usefulness. Though this is of all others the
most erroneous method of estimation; yet upon
no other principle is it possible to account for the
general indifference with respect to the death of
infants.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>
  <h4 class='c017'><i>Of Diseased Parents.</i></h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>One great source of the diseases of children is, the
<span class='sc'>unhealthiness of Parents</span>. It would be as reasonable
to expect a rich crop from a barren soil, as
that strong and healthy children should be born of
parents whose constitutions have been worn out with
intemperance or disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ingenious writer<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c010'><sup>[6]</sup></a> observes, that on the constitution
of mothers depends originally that of their
offspring. No one who believes this, will be surprised,
on a view of the female world, to find diseases
and death so frequent among children. A delicate
female, brought up within doors, an utter stranger
to exercise and open air, who lives on tea and other
slops, may bring a child into the world, but it will
hardly be fit to live. The first blast of disease will
nip the tender plant in the bud: or, should it
struggle through a few years existence, its feeble
frame, shaken with convulsions from every trivial
cause, will be unable to perform the common functions
of life, and prove a burden to society.</p>

<p class='c008'>If to the delicacy of mothers, we add the irregular
lives of fathers, we shall see further cause to believe
that children are often hurt by the constitution
of their parents. A sickly frame may be originally
induced by hardships or intemperance, but chiefly
by the latter. It is impossible that a course of vice
should not spoil the best constitution: and, did the
evil terminate here, it would be a just punishment
for the folly of the sufferer; but when once a disease
is contracted and riveted in the habit, it is entailed
on posterity. What a dreadful inheritance is the
gout, the scurvy, or the King’s evil, to transmit to
our offspring! how happy had it been for the heir
of many a great estate, had he been born a beggar,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>rather than to inherit his father’s fortunes at the expence
of inheriting his diseases!</p>

<p class='c008'>A person labouring under any incurable malady
ought not to marry. He thereby not only shortens
his own life, but transmits misery to others: but
when both parties are deeply tainted with the scrophula,
the scurvy, or the like, the effects must be
still worse. If such have any issue, they must be
miserable indeed. Want of attention to these things,
in forming connexions for life, has rooted out more
families than plague, famine, or the sword; and as
long as these connexions are formed from mercenary
views, the evil will be continued<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c010'><sup>[7]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In our matrimonial contracts, it is amazing so little
regard is had to the health and form of the object.
Our sportsmen know, that the generous courser
cannot be bred out of the foundered jade, nor the
sagacious spaniel out of the snarling cur. This is
settled upon immutable laws. The man who marries
a woman of a sickly constitution, and descended
of unhealthy parents, whatever his views may be,
cannot be said to act a prudent part. A diseased
woman may prove fertile; should this be the case,
the family must become an infirmary: what prospect
of happiness the father of such a family has,
we shall leave any one to judge<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c010'><sup>[8]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such children as have the misfortune to be born
of diseased parents, will require to be nursed with
greater care than others. This is the only way to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>make amends for the defects of constitution; and it
will often go a great length. A healthy nurse, wholesome
air, and sufficient exercise, will do wonders.
But when these are neglected, little is to be expected
from any other quarter. The defects of constitution
cannot be supplied by medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who inherit any family disease ought to be
very circumspect in their manner of living. They
should consider well the nature of such disease, and
guard against it by a proper regimen. It is certain,
that family diseases have often, by proper care, been
kept off for one generation; and there is reason to
believe, that, by persisting in the same course, such
diseases might at length be wholly eradicated. This
is a subject very little regarded, though of the
greatest importance. Family constitutions are as
capable of improvement as family estates; and the
libertine, who impairs the one, does greater injury
to his posterity, than the prodigal who squanders
away the other.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of the Clothing of Children.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The clothing of an infant is so simple a matter,
that it is surprising how any person should err in it;
yet many children lose their lives, and others are
deformed, by inattention to this article.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nature knows no use of clothes to an infant, but
to keep it warm. All that is necessary for this purpose,
is to wrap it in a soft loose covering. Were a
mother left to the dictates of Nature alone, she would
certainly pursue this course. But the business of
dressing an infant has long been out of the hands of
mothers, and has at last become a secret which none
but adepts pretend to understand.</p>

<p class='c008'>From the most early ages it has been thought necessary,
that a woman in labour should have some
person to attend her. This in time became a business;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and, as in all others, those who were employed
in it strove to outdo one another in the different
branches of their profession. The dressing of a child
came of course to be considered as the midwife’s
province, who no doubt imagined, that the more
dexterity she could shew in this article, the more her
skill would be admired. Her attempts were seconded
by the vanity of parents, who, too often desirous of
making a shew of the infant as soon as it was born,
were ambitious to have as much finery heaped upon
it as possible. Thus it came to be thought as necessary
for a midwife to excel in bracing and dressing an
infant, as for a surgeon to be expert in applying
bandages to a broken limb; and the poor child, as
soon as it came into the world, had as many rollers
and wrappers applied to its body, as if every bone
had been fractured in the birth; while these were
often so tight, as not only to gall and wound its tender
frame, but even to obstruct the motion of the
heart, lungs, and other organs necessary for life.</p>

<p class='c008'>In most parts of Britain, the practice of rolling
children with so many bandages is now, in some measure,
laid aside; but it would still be a difficult task
to persuade the generality of mankind, that the shape
of an infant does not entirely depend on the care of
the midwife. So far, however, are all her endeavours
to mend the shape from being successful,
that they constantly operate the contrary way, and
mankind become deformed in proportion to the
means used to prevent it. How little deformity of
body is to be found among uncivilized nations? So
little indeed, that it is vulgarly believed they put all
their deformed children to death. The truth is, they
hardly know such a thing as a deformed child.
Neither should we, if we followed their example.
Savage nations never think of manacling their children.
They allow them the full use of every organ,
carry them abroad in the open air, wash their bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>daily in cold water, &#38;c. By this management, their
children become so strong and hardy, that, by the
time our puny infants get out of the nurse’s arms,
theirs are able to shift for themselves<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c010'><sup>[9]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among brute animals, no art is necessary to procure
a fine shape. Though many of them are extremely
delicate when they come into the world,
yet we never find them grow crooked for want of
swaddling bands. Is nature less generous to the
human kind? No: but we take the business out of
Nature’s hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only the analogy of other animals, but the
very feelings of infants tell us, they ought to be
kept easy and free from all pressure. They cannot
indeed tell their complaints; but they can shew signs
of pain; and this they never fail to do, by crying
when hurt by their clothes. No sooner are they
freed from their bracings, than they seem pleased
and happy; yet, strange infatuation! the moment
they hold their peace, they are again committed to
their chains.</p>

<p class='c008'>If we consider the body of an infant as a bundle
of soft pipes, replenished with fluids in continual
motion, the danger of pressure will appear in the
strongest light. Nature, in order to make way for
the growth of children, has formed their bodies
soft and flexible; and lest they should receive any
injury from pressure in the womb, has surrounded
the <i>fœtus</i> every where with fluids. This shews the
care which Nature takes to prevent all unequal
pressure on the bodies of infants, and to defend
them against every thing that might in the least
cramp or confine their motions.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Even the bones of an infant are so soft and cartilaginous,
that they readily yield to the slightest
pressure, and easily assume a bad shape, which can
never after be remedied. Hence it is, that so
many people appear with high shoulders, crooked
spines, and flat breasts, who were as well proportioned
at their birth as others, but had the misfortune
to be squeezed out of shape by the application
of stays and bandages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pressure, by obstructing the circulation, likewise
prevents the equal distribution of nourishment to
the different parts of the body, by which means
the growth becomes unequal. One part grows too
large, while another remains too small; and thus
in time the whole frame becomes disproportioned
and misshapen. To this we must add, that when
a child is cramped in its clothes, it naturally shrinks
from the part that is hurt; and, by putting its body
into unnatural postures it becomes deformed by
habit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Deformity of body may indeed proceed from
weakness or disease; but, in general, it is the effect
of improper clothing. Nine-tenths, at least, of the
deformity among mankind, must be imputed to this
cause. A deformed body is not only disagreeable to
the eye, but by a bad figure both the animal and
vital functions must be impeded, and of course health
impaired. Hence few people remarkably mishapen
are strong or healthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The new motions which commence at the birth,
as the circulation of the whole mass of blood through
the lungs, respiration, the peristaltic motion, &#38;c.
afford another strong argument for keeping the body
of an infant free from all pressure. These organs, not
having been accustomed to move, are easily stopped;
but when this happens, death must ensue. Hardly
any method could be devised more effectually to stop
these motions, than bracing the body too tight with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>rollers<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c010'><sup>[10]</sup></a> and bandages. Were these to be applied
in the same manner to the body of an adult for an
equal length of time, they would hardly fail to hurt
the digestion and make him sick. How much more
hurtful they must prove to the tender bodies of infants,
we shall leave any one to judge.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whoever considers these things will not be surprised,
that so many children die of convulsions soon
after the birth. These fits are generally attributed to
some inward cause; but in fact, they oftener proceed
from our own imprudent conduct. I have known a
child seized with convulsion-fits soon after the midwife
had done swaddling it, who, upon taking off
the rollers and bandages, was immediately relieved,
and never had the disease afterwards. Numerous examples
of this might be given, were they necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be safer to fasten the cloths of an infant
with strings than pins, as these often gall and irritate
their tender skins, and occasion disorders. Pins have
been found sticking above half an inch into the body
of a child, after it had died of convulsion fits, which,
in all probability, proceeded from that cause.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children are not only hurt by the tightness of
their clothes, but also by the quantity. Every child
has some degree of fever after the birth; and if it
be loaded with too many clothes, the fever must be
increased. But this is not all; the child is generally
laid in bed with the mother, who is often likewise
feverish; to which we may add the heat of the bed-chamber,
the wines, and other heating things, too
frequently given to children immediately after the
birth. When all these are combined, which does not
seldom happen, they must increase the fever to such
a degree as will endanger the life of the infant.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The danger of keeping infants too hot will further
appear, if we consider that, after they have been for
some time in the situation mentioned above, they are
often sent into the country to be nursed in a cold
house. Is it any wonder, if a child, from such a
transition, catches a mortal cold, or contracts some
other fatal disease? When an infant is kept too
hot, its lungs, not being sufficiently expanded, are
apt to remain weak and flaccid for life; hence
proceed coughs, consumptions, and other diseases
of the breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would answer little purpose to specify the particular
species of dress proper for an infant. These
will always vary in different countries, according to
custom and the humour of parents. The great rule
to be observed is, <i>That a child have no more clothes
than are necessary to keep it warm, and that they be
quite easy for its body</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stays are the very bane of infants. A volume
would not suffice to point out all the bad effects of
this ridiculous piece of dress both on children and
adults. The madness in favour of stays seems,
however, to be somewhat abated; and it is to be
hoped the world will, in time, become wise enough
to know, that the human shape does not solely depend
upon whale-bone and bend-leather<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c010'><sup>[11]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall only add with respect to the clothes of
children, that they ought to be kept thoroughly clean.
Children perspire more than adults; and if their
clothes be not frequently changed, they become very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>hurtful. Dirty clothes not only gall and fret the
tender skins of infants, but likewise occasion ill
smells; and, what is worse, tend to produce vermin
and cutaneous diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cleanliness is not only agreeable to the eye, but
tends greatly to preserve the health of children. It
promotes the perspiration, and, by that means, frees
the body from superfluous humours, which, if retained,
could not fail to occasion diseases. No
mother or nurse can have any excuse for allowing a
child to be dirty. Poverty may oblige her to give it
coarse clothes; but if she does not keep them clean,
it must be her own fault.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of the Food of Children.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Nature not only points out the food proper for
an infant, but actually prepares it. This, however,
is not sufficient to prevent some who think themselves
wiser than Nature, from attempting to bring up their
children without her provision. Nothing can shew
the disposition which mankind have to depart from
Nature, more than their endeavouring to bring up
children without the breast. The mother’s milk, or
that of a healthy nurse, is unquestionably the best
food for an infant. Neither art nor nature can afford
a proper substitute for it. Children may seem to
thrive for a few months without the breast; but,
when teething, the small-pox, and other diseases incident
to childhood, come on, they generally perish.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child, soon after the birth, shews an inclination
to suck; and there is no reason why it should not
be gratified. It is true, the mother’s milk does not
always come immediately after the birth; but this
is the way to bring it: besides, the first milk that
the child can squeeze out of the breast answers the
purpose of cleansing, better than all the drugs in
the apothecary’s shop, and at the same time prevents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>inflammations of the breast, fevers, and other
diseases incident to mothers.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is strange how people came to think that the
first thing given to a child should be drugs. This
is beginning with medicine by times, and no wonder
if they generally ended with it. It sometimes happens,
indeed, that a child does not discharge the
<i>meconium</i> so soon as could be wished; this has induced
physicians, in such cases, to give something
of an opening nature to cleanse the first passages.
Midwives have improved upon this hint, and never
fail to give syrups, oils, &#38;c. whether they be necessary
or not. Cramming an infant with such indigestible
stuff as soon as it is born, can hardly fail
to make it sick, and is more likely to occasion diseases,
than to prevent them. Children are seldom
long after the birth without having passage both by
stool and urine; though these evacuations may be
wanting for some time without any danger. But if
children must have something before they be allowed
the breast, let it be a little thin water-pap,
to which may be added an equal quantity of new
milk; or rather water alone, with the addition of a
little raw sugar. If this be given without any wines
or spiceries, it will neither heat the blood, load the
stomach, nor occasion gripes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Upon the first sight of an infant, almost every
person is struck with the idea of its being weak,
feeble, and wanting support. This naturally suggests
the need of cordials. Accordingly wines are universally
mixed with the first food of children. Nothing
can be more fallacious than this way of reasoning,
or more hurtful to infants than the conduct founded
upon it. Children require very little food for
some time after the birth; and what they receive
should be thin, weak, light, and of a cooling quality.
A very small quantity of wine is sufficient to
heat and inflame the blood of an infant; but every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>person conversant in these matters must know, that
most of the diseases of infants proceed from the heat
of their humours.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the mother or nurse has enough of milk, the
child will need little or no other food before the third
or four month. It will then be proper to give it,
once or twice a day, a little of some food that is easy
of digestion, as water-pap, milk-pottage, weak
broth with bread in it, and such like. This will
ease the mother, will accustom the child by degrees
to take food, and will render the weaning both less
difficult and less dangerous. All great and sudden
transitions are to be avoided in nursing. For this
purpose, the food of children ought not only to be
simple, but to resemble, as nearly as possible, the
properties of milk. Indeed milk itself should make
a principal part of their food, not only before they
are weaned, but for some time after.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next to milk, we would recommend good light
bread. Bread may be given to a child as soon as it
shews an inclination to chew; and it may at all times
be allowed as much plain bread as it will eat. The
very chewing of bread will promote the cutting of
the teeth, and the discharge of <i>saliva</i>, while, by mixing
with the nurse’s milk in the stomach, it will afford
an excellent nourishment. Children discover an
early inclination to chew whatever is put into their
hands. Parents observe the inclination, but generally
mistake the object. Instead of giving the child something
which may at once exercise its gums and afford
it nourishment, they commonly put into its
hands a piece of hard metal, or impenetrable coral.
A crust of bread is the best gum-stick. It not only
answers the purpose better than any thing else, but
has the additional properties of nourishing the child
and carrying the saliva down to the stomach, which
is too valuable a liquor to be lost.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>Bread, besides being used dry, may be many
ways prepared into food for children. One of the best
methods is to boil it in water, afterwards pouring the
water off, and mixing with the bread a proper quantity
of new milk unboiled. Milk is both more
wholesome and nourishing this way than boiled, and
is less apt to occasion costiveness. For a child farther
advanced, bread may be mixed in veal or chicken
broth, made into puddings, or the like. Bread is a
proper food for children at all times, provided it be
plain, made of wholesome grain, and well fermented;
but when enriched with fruits, sugars, or
such things, it becomes very unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is soon enough to allow children animal food
when they have got teeth to eat it. They should
never taste it till after they are weaned, and even
then they ought to use it sparingly. Indeed, when
children live wholly on vegetable food, it is apt to
sour on their stomachs; but, on the other hand,
too much flesh heats the body, and occasions fevers
and other inflammatory diseases. This plainly
points out a due mixture of animal and vegetable
food as most proper for children.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things prove more hurtful to infants, than the
common method of sweetening their food. It entices
them to take more than they ought to do, which
makes them grow fat and bloated. It is pretty certain,
if the food of children were quite plain, that
they would never take more than enough. Their
excesses are entirely owing to nurses. If a child be
gorged with food at all hours, and enticed to take it,
by making it sweet and agreeable to the palate, is it
any wonder that such a child should in time be induced
to crave more food than it ought to have?</p>

<p class='c008'>Children may be hurt by too little as well as too
much food. After a child is weaned, it ought to be
fed four or five times a day; but should never be
accustomed to eat in the night; neither should it have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>too much at a time. Children thrive best with small
quantities of food frequently given. This neither
overloads the stomach nor hurts the digestion, and
is certainly most agreeable to Nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Writers on nursing have inveighed with such
vehemence against giving children too much food,
that many parents, by endeavouring to shun that
error, have run into the opposite extreme, and ruined
the constitutions of their children. But the error of
pinching children in their food is more hurtful than
the other extreme. Nature has many ways of relieving
herself when overcharged; but a child, who
is pinched with hunger, will never become a strong
or healthy man. That errors are frequently committed
on both sides, we are ready to acknowledge;
but where one child is hurt by the quantity of its
food, ten suffer from the quality. This is the principal
evil, and claims our strictest attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people imagine, that the food which they
themselves love cannot be bad for their children:
but this notion is very absurd. In the more advanced
periods of life we often acquire an inclination
for food, which when children we could not
endure. Besides, there are many things that by habit
may agree very well with the stomach of a grown
person, which would be hurtful to a child; as high-seasoned,
salted, and smoke-dried provisions, &#38;c.
It would also be improper to feed children with fat
meat, strong broths, rich soups, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>All strong liquors are hurtful to children. Some
parents teach their children to guzzle ale, and other
fermented liquors, at every meal. Such a practice
cannot fail to do mischief. These children seldom
escape the violence of the small-pox, measles, hooping
cough, or some inflammatory disorder. Milk,
water, butter-milk, or whey, are the most proper
for children to drink. If they have any thing stronger,
it may be fine small beer, or a little wine mixed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>water. The stomachs of children can digest well
enough without the assistance of warm stimulants:
besides, being naturally hot, they are easily hurt by
every thing of a heating quality.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things are more hurtful to children than unripe
fruits. They weaken the powers of digestion,
and sour and relax the stomach, by which means it
becomes a proper nest for insects. Children indeed
shew a great inclination for fruit, and I am apt to
believe, that if good ripe fruit were allowed them
in proper quantity, it would have no bad effects. We
never find a natural inclination wrong, if properly
regulated. Fruits are generally of a cooling nature,
and correct the heat and acrimony of the humours.
This is what most children require; only care should
be taken lest they exceed. Indeed the best way to
prevent children from going to excess in the use of
fruit, or eating that which is bad, is to allow them
a proper quantity of what is good<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c010'><sup>[12]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Roots which contain a crude viscid juice should
be sparingly given to children. They fill the body
with gross humours, and tend to produce eruptive
diseases. This caution is peculiarly necessary for
the poor; glad to obtain at a small price what will
fill the bellies of their children, they stuff them two
or three times a day with greasy potatoes, or other
crude vegetables. Children had better eat a smaller
quantity of food which yields a wholesome nourishment,
than be crammed with what their digestive
powers are unable properly to assimilate.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Butter ought likewise to be sparingly given to
children. It both relaxes the stomach, and produces
gross humours. Indeed, most things that are fat or
oily, have this effect. Butter, when salted, becomes
still more hurtful. Instead of butter, so liberally
given to children in most parts of Britain, we would
recommend honey. Honey is not only wholesome,
but cooling, cleansing, and tends to sweeten the
humours. Children who eat honey are seldom
troubled with worms: they are also less subject to
cutaneous diseases, as itch, scabbed head, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people err in thinking that the diet of children
ought to be altogether moist. When children
live entirely upon slops, it relaxes their solids, renders
them weak, and disposes them to the rickets,
the scrophula, and other glandular disorders. Relaxation
is one of the most general causes of the diseases
of children. Every thing therefore which tends
to unbrace their solids, ought to be carefully avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would not be understood by these observations
as confining children to any particular kind of
food. Their diet may be frequently varied, provided
always that sufficient regard be had to simplicity.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of the Exercise of Children.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Of all the causes which conspire to render the life
of man short and miserable, none has greater influence
than the want of proper <span class='fss'>EXERCISE</span>: healthy parents,
wholesome food, and proper clothing, will avail little,
where exercise is neglected. Sufficient exercise will
make up for several defects in nursing; but nothing
can supply the want of it. It is absolutely necessary to
the health, the growth, and the strength of children.</p>

<p class='c008'>The desire of exercise is coëval with life itself.
Were this principle attended to, many diseases might
be prevented. But, while indolence and sedentary
employments prevent two-thirds of mankind from
either taking sufficient exercise themselves, or giving
it to their children, what have we to expect but diseases
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>and deformity among their offspring? The
rickets, so destructive to children, never appeared
in Britain till manufactures began to flourish, and
people, attracted by the love of gain, left the country
to follow sedentary employments in great towns.
It is amongst these people that this disease chiefly
prevails, and not only deforms, but kills many of
their offspring.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conduct of other young animals shews the
propriety of giving exercise to children. Every
other animal makes use of its organs of motion as
soon as it can, and many of them, even when under
no necessity of moving in quest of food, cannot be
restrained without force. This is evidently the
case with the calf, the lamb, and most other young
animals. If these creatures were not permitted to
frisk about and take exercise, they would soon die
or become diseased. The same inclination appears
very early in the human species; but as they are
not able to take exercise themselves, it is the business
of their parents and nurses to assist them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children may be exercised various ways. The
best method, while they are light, is to carry them
about in the nurse’s arms<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c010'><sup>[13]</sup></a>. This gives the nurse
an opportunity of talking to the child, and of pointing
out every thing that may please and delight its
fancy. Besides, it is much safer than swinging an
infant in a machine, or leaving it to the care of
such as are not fit to take care of themselves. Nothing
can be more absurd than to set one child to
keep another: this conduct has proved fatal to many
infants, and has rendered others miserable for life.</p>

<p class='c008'>When children begin to walk, the safest and best
method of leading them about, is by the hands. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>common way, of swinging them in leading-strings
fixed to their backs, has several bad consequences.
It makes them throw their bodies forward, and press
with their whole weight upon the stomach and
breast; by this means the breathing is obstructed,
the breast flattened, and the bowels compressed;
which must hurt the digestion, and occasion consumptions
of the lungs, and other diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a common notion, that if children are set
upon their feet too soon, their legs will become
crooked. There is reason to believe, that the very
reverse of this is true. Every member acquires
strength in proportion as it is exercised. The limbs
of children are weak indeed, but their bodies are
proportionally light; and had they skill to direct
themselves, they would soon be able to support
their own weight. Who ever heard of any other
animal that became crooked by using its legs too
soon? Indeed, if a child is not permitted to make
any use of its legs till a considerable time after the
birth, and be then set upon them with its whole
weight at once, there may be some danger; but this
proceeds entirely from the child’s not having been
accustomed to use its legs from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mothers of the poorer sort think they are great
gainers by making their children lie or sit while they
themselves work. In this they are greatly mistaken.
By neglecting to give their children exercise, they are
obliged to keep them a long time before they can do
any thing for themselves, and to spend more on
medicine than would have paid for proper care.</p>

<p class='c008'>To take care of their children, is the most useful
business in which even the poor can be employed:
but, alas! it is not always in their power.
Poverty often obliges them to neglect their offspring,
in order to procure the necessaries of life. When
this is the case, it becomes the interest as well as
the duty of the public to assist them. Ten thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>times more benefit would accrue to the State, by
enabling the poor to bring up their own children,
than from all the hospitals<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c010'><sup>[14]</sup></a> that ever can be erected
for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whoever considers the structure of the human
body will soon be convinced of the necessity of exercise
for the health of children. The body is
composed of an infinite number of tubes, whose
fluids cannot be pushed on without the action and
pressure of the muscles. But, if the fluids remain
inactive, obstructions must happen, and the humours
will of course be vitiated, which cannot fail
to occasion diseases. Nature has furnished both
the vessels which carry the blood and lymph with
numerous valves, in order that the action of every
muscle might push forward their contents; but
without action, this admirable contrivance can have
no effect. This part of the animal œconomy proves
to a demonstration the necessity of exercise for the
preservation of health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Arguments to shew the importance of exercise
might be drawn from every part of the animal œconomy;
without exercise, the circulation of the blood
cannot be properly carried on, nor the different secretions
duly performed; without exercise, the fluids
cannot be properly prepared, nor the solids rendered
strong or firm. The action of the heart, the
motion of the lungs, and all the vital functions, are
greatly assisted by exercise. But to point out the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>manner in which these effects are produced, would
lead us farther into the œconomy of the human
body, than most of those for whom this treatise is
intended would be able to follow. We shall therefore
only add, that, where exercise is neglected,
none of the animal functions can be duly performed;
and when that is the case, the whole constitution
must go to wreck.</p>

<p class='c008'>A good constitution ought certainly to be our first
object in the management of children. It lays a
foundation for their being useful and happy in life;
and whoever neglects it, not only fails in his duty
to his offspring, but to society.</p>

<p class='c008'>One very common error of parents, by which
they hurt the constitutions of their children, is the
sending them too young to school. This is often
done solely to prevent trouble. When the child is
at school, he needs no keeper. Thus the schoolmaster
is made the nurse; and the poor child is fixed
to a seat seven or eight hours a day, which time
ought to be spent in exercise and diversions. Sitting
so long cannot fail to produce the worst effects
upon the body; nor is the mind less injured. Early
application weakens the faculties, and often fixes in
the mind an aversion to books, which continues for
life<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c010'><sup>[15]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, suppose this were the way to make children
scholars, it certainly ought not to be done at the
expence of their constitutions. Our ancestors, who
seldom went to school very young, were not less
learned than we. But we imagine the boy’s education
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>will be quite marred, unless he be carried to
school in his nurse’s arms. No wonder if such hotbed
plants seldom become either scholars or men!</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only the confinement of children in public
schools, but their number, often proves hurtful.
Children are much injured by being kept in crowds
within doors; their breathing not only renders the
place unwholesome, but if any one of them happens
to be diseased, the rest catch the infection. A
single child has been often known to communicate
the bloody flux, the hooping-cough, the itch, or
other diseases, to almost every individual in a numerous
school.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, if fashion must prevail, and infants are to be
sent to school, we would recommend it to teachers,
as they value the interests of society, not to confine
them too long at a time, but allow them to run
about and play at such active diversions as may promote
their growth, and strengthen their constitutions.
Were boys, instead of being whipped for
stealing an hour to run, ride, swim, or the like,
encouraged to employ a proper part of their time in
these manly and useful exercises, it would have
many excellent effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be of great service to boys, if, at a
proper age, they were taught the military exercise.
This would increase their strength, inspire them
with courage, and when their country called for
their assistance, would enable them to act in her
defence, without being obliged to undergo a tedious
and troublesome course of instructions, at a time
when they are less fit to learn new motions, gestures,
&#38;c.<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c010'><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>An effeminate education will infallibly spoil the
best natural constitution; and if boys are brought
up in a more delicate manner than even girls ought
to be, they never will be men.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is the common education of girls less hurtful
to the constitution than that of boys. Miss is
set down to her frame before she can put on her
clothes; and is taught to believe, that to excel at
the needle is the only thing that can entitle her to
general esteem. It is unnecessary here to insist
upon the dangerous consequences of obliging girls
to sit too much. They are pretty well known, and
are too often felt at a certain time of life. But supposing
this critical period to be got over, greater
dangers still await them when they come to be mothers.
Women who have been early accustomed to
a sedentary life, generally run great hazard in child-bed;
while those who have been used to romp
about, and take sufficient exercise, are seldom in
any danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>One hardly meets with a girl who can at the same
time boast of early performances by the needle, and
a good constitution. Close and early confinement
generally occasions indigestions, head-achs, pale
complexions, pain of the stomach, loss of appetite,
coughs, consumptions of the lungs, and deformity
of body. The last of these indeed is not to be
wondered at, considering the awkward postures in
which girls sit at many kinds of needle-work, and
the delicate flexible state of their bodies in the
early periods of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Would mothers, instead of having their daughters
instructed in many trifling accomplishments,
employ them in plain work and housewifery, and
allow them sufficient exercise in the open air, they
would both make them more healthy mothers, and
more useful members of society. I am no enemy
to genteel accomplishments, but would have them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>only considered as secondary, and always disregarded
when they impair health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people imagine it a great advantage for
children to be early taught to earn their bread.
This opinion is certainly right, provided they were
so employed as not to hurt their health or growth;
but, when these suffer, society, instead of being benefited,
is a real loser by their labour. There are
few employments, except sedentary ones, by which
children can earn a livelihood; and if they be set to
these too soon, it ruins their constitutions. Thus,
by gaining a few years from childhood, we generally
lose twice as many in the latter period of life,
and even render the person less useful while he does
live.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to be satisfied of the truth of this observation,
we need only look into the great manufacturing
towns, where we shall find a puny degenerate
race of people, weak and sickly all their
lives, seldom exceeding the middle period of life;
or if they do, being unfit for business, they become
a burden to society. Thus arts and manufactures,
though they may increase the riches of a country,
are by no means favourable to the health of its inhabitants.
Good policy would therefore require,
that such people as labour during life, should not
be set too early to work. Every person conversant
in the breed of horses, or other working
animals, knows, that if they be set to hard labour
too soon, they never will turn out to advantage.
This is equally true with respect to the human
species.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are nevertheless various ways of employing
young people without hurting their health.
The easier parts of gardening, husbandry, or any
business carried on without doors, are most proper.
These are employments which most young people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>are fond of, and some parts of them may always
be adapted to their age, taste, and strength<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c010'><sup>[17]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such parents, however, as are under the necessity
of employing their children within doors, ought
to allow them sufficient time for active diversions
without. This would both encourage them to do
more work, and prevent their constitutions from
being hurt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some imagine, that exercise within doors is sufficient;
but they are greatly mistaken. One hour
spent in running, or any other exercise without
doors, is worth ten within. When children cannot
go abroad, they may indeed be exercised at home.
The best method of doing this, is to make them
run about in a long room, or dance. This last
kind of exercise, if not carried to excess, is of excellent
service to young people. It cheers the spirits,
promotes perspiration, strengthens the limbs,
&#38;c. I know an eminent physician who used to say,
that he made his children dance, instead of giving
them physic. It were well if more people followed
his example.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <span class='fss'>COLD BATH</span> may be considered as an aid to
exercise. By it the body is braced and strengthened,
the circulation and secretions promoted, and,
were it conducted with prudence, many diseases, as
the rickets, scrophula, &#38;c. might thereby be prevented.
The ancients, who took every method to
render children hardy and robust, were no strangers
to the use of the cold bath; and, if we may credit
report, the practice of immersing children daily in
cold water must have been very common among
our ancestors.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The greatest objection to the use of the cold bath
arises from the superstitious prejudices of nurses.
These are often so strong, that it is impossible to
bring them to make a proper use of it. I have
known some of them who would not dry a child’s
skin after bathing it, lest it should destroy the effect
of the water. Others will even put cloths dipt in
the water upon the child, and either put it to bed,
or suffer it to go about in that condition. Some
believe, that the whole virtue of the water depends
upon its being dedicated to a particular saint:
while others place their confidence in a certain
number of dips, as three, seven, nine, or the like;
and the world could not persuade them, if these do
not succeed, to try it a little longer. Thus, by the
whims of nurses, children lose the benefit of the
cold bath, and the hopes of the physician from that
medicine are often frustrated.</p>

<p class='c008'>We ought not, however, entirely to set aside the
cold bath, because some nurses make a wrong use
of it. Every child, when in health, should at
least have its extremities daily washed in cold water.
This is a partial use of the cold bath, and is better
than none. In winter this may suffice; but, in the
warm season, if a child be relaxed, or seem to have
a tendency to the rickets or scrophula, its whole
body ought to be frequently immersed in cold
water. Care however must be taken not to do this
when the body is hot, or the stomach full. The
child should be dipt only once at a time, should be
taken out immediately, and have its skin well
rubbed with a dry cloth.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>The bad Effects of unwholesome Air upon Children.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Few things prove more destructive to children
than confined or unwholesome air. This is one
reason why so few of those infants, who are put
into hospitals, or parish workhouses, live. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>places are generally crowded with old, sickly, and
infirm people; by which means the air is rendered
so extremely pernicious, that it becomes a poison
to infants.</p>

<p class='c008'>Want of wholesome air is likewise destructive to
many of the children born in great towns. There
the poorer sort of inhabitants live in low, dirty,
confined houses, to which the fresh air has hardly
any access. Though grown people, who are hardy
and robust, may live in such situations, yet they
generally prove fatal to their offspring, few of
whom arrive at maturity, and those who do are
weak and deformed. As such people are not in a
condition to carry their children abroad into the
open air, we must lay our account with losing the
greater part of them. But the rich have not this
excuse. It is their business to see that their children
be daily carried abroad, and that they be kept
in the open air for a sufficient time. This will always
succeed better if the mother goes along with
them. Servants are often negligent in these matters,
and allow a child to sit or lie on the damp
ground, instead of leading or carrying it about.
The mother surely needs air as well as her children;
and how can she be better employed than in
attending them?</p>

<p class='c008'>A very bad custom prevails, of making children
sleep in small apartments, or crowding two or three
beds into one chamber. Instead of this, the nursery
ought always to be the largest and best aired room
in the house. When children are confined in small
apartments, the air not only becomes unwholesome,
but the heat relaxes their solids, renders them delicate,
and disposes them to colds and many other
disorders. Nor is the custom of wrapping them
up too close in cradles less pernicious. One would
think that nurses were afraid lest children should
suffer by breathing free air, as many of them actually
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>cover the child’s face while asleep, and others
wrap a covering over the whole cradle, by which
means the child is forced to breathe the same air
over and over all the time it sleeps. Cradles indeed
are on many accounts hurtful to children, and
it would be better if the use of them were totally
laid aside<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c010'><sup>[18]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A child is generally laid to sleep with all its
clothes on; and if a number of others are heaped
above them, it must be overheated; by which
means it cannot fail to catch cold on being taken out
of the cradle, and exposed to the open air with only
its usual clothing, which is too frequently the case.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children who are kept within doors all day, and
sleep all night in warm close apartments, may, with
great propriety, be compared to plants, nursed in a
hot-house, instead of the open air. Though such
plants may by this means be kept alive for some
time, they will never arrive at that degree of
strength, vigour, and magnitude, which they would
have acquired in the open air, nor would they be able
to bear it afterwards, should they be exposed to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children brought up in the country, who have
been accustomed to open air, should not be too
early sent to great towns, where it is confined and
unwholesome. This is frequently done with a view
to forward their education, but proves very hurtful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>to their health. All schools and seminaries of
learning ought, if possible, to be so situated as to
have fresh, dry, wholesome air, and should never
be too much crowded.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without entering into a detail of the particular
advantages of wholesome air to children, or of the
bad consequences which proceed from the want of
it, I shall only observe, that, of several thousands
of children which have been under my care, I do
not remember one instance of a single child who
continued healthy in a close confined situation; but
have often known the most obstinate diseases cured
by removing them from such a situation to an open
free air.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Nurses.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>It is not here intended to lay down rules for the
choice of nurses. This would be wasting time.
Common sense will direct every one to chuse a woman
who is healthy, and has plenty of milk<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c010'><sup>[19]</sup></a>. If
she be at the same time cleanly, careful, and goodnatured,
she can hardly fail to make a proper nurse.
After all, however, the only certain proof of a
good nurse, is a healthy child upon her breast. But,
as the misconduct of nurses often proves fatal to
children, it will be of importance to point out a
few of their most baneful errors, in order to rouse
the attention of parents, and to make them look
more strictly into the conduct of those to whom
they commit the care of their infant offspring.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though it admits of some exceptions, yet we
may lay it down as a general rule, <i>that every woman
who nurses for hire should be carefully looked after,
otherwise she will not do her duty</i>. For this reason
parents ought always to have their children nursed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>under their own eye, if possible; and where this
cannot be done, they should be extremely circumspect
in the choice of those persons to whom they
entrust them. It is folly to imagine that any woman,
who abandons her own child to suckle another
for the sake of gain, should feel all the affections
of a parent towards her nursing; yet so
necessary are these affections in a nurse, that, but
for them, the human race would soon be extinct.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most common faults of those who
nurse for hire, is to dose children with stupefactives,
or such things as lull them asleep. An indolent
nurse, who does not give a child sufficient
exercise in the open air to make it sleep, and does
not chuse to be disturbed by it in the night, will
seldom fail to procure for it a dose of laudanum,
diacodium, saffron, or what answers the same purpose,
a dose of spirits, or other strong liquors.
These, though they be certain poison to infants,
are every day administered by many who bear the
character of very good nurses<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c010'><sup>[20]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A nurse who has not milk enough is apt to imagine
that this defect may be supplied by giving the
child wines, cordial waters, or other strong liquors.
This is an egregious mistake. The only thing that
has any chance to supply the place of the nurse’s
milk, must be somewhat nearly of the same quality,
as cow’s milk, ass’s milk, or beef tea, with good
bread. It never can be done by the help of strong
liquors. These, instead of nourishing an infant,
never fail to produce the contrary effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children are often hurt by nurses suffering them
to cry long and vehemently. This strains their
tender bodies, and frequently occasions ruptures,
inflammations of the throat, lungs, &#38;c. A child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>never continues to cry long without some cause,
which might always be discovered by proper attention;
and the nurse who can hear an infant cry till
it has almost spent itself, without endeavouring to
please it, must be cruel indeed, and is unworthy
to be intrusted with the care of an human creature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurses who deal much in medicine are always to
be suspected. They trust to it, and neglect their
duty. I never knew a good nurse who had her
Godfrey’s cordials, Daffy’s elixirs, &#38;c. at hand.
Such generally imagine, that a dose of medicine
will make up for all defects in food, air, exercise,
and cleanliness. By errors of this kind, I will venture
to say, that one half the children who die annually
in London lose their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>Allowing children to continue long wet, is another
very pernicious custom of indolent nurses.
This is not only disagreeable, but it galls and frets
the infant, and by relaxing the solids, occasions
scrophulas, rickets, and other diseases. A dirty
nurse is always to be suspected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nature often attempts to free the bodies of children
from bad humours, by throwing them upon
the skin: by this means fevers and other diseases
are prevented. Nurses are apt to mistake such critical
eruptions for an itch, or some other infectious
disorder. Accordingly they take every method to
drive them in. In this way many children lose
their lives; and no wonder, as Nature is opposed
in the very method she takes to relieve them. It
ought to be a rule, which every nurse should observe,
never to stop any eruption without proper advice,
or being well assured that it is not of a critical
nature. At any rate, it is never to be done
without previous evacuations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Loose stools is another method by which Nature
often prevents or carries off the diseases of infants.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>If these proceed too far, no doubt they ought to be
checked; but this is never to be done without the
greatest caution. Nurses, upon the first appearance
of loose stools, frequently fly to the use of astringents,
or such things as bind the body. Hence
inflammatory fevers, and other fatal diseases, are
occasioned. A dose of rhubarb, a gentle vomit,
or some other evacuation, should always precede
the use of astringent medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the greatest faults of nurses is, concealing
the diseases of children from their parents. This
they are extremely ready to do, especially when the
disease is the effect of their own negligence. Many
instances might be given of persons who have been
rendered lame for life by a fall from their nurse’s
arms, which she, through fear, concealed till the
misfortune was past cure. Every parent who intrusts
a nurse with the care of a child, ought to
give her the strictest charge not to conceal the most
trifling disorder or misfortune that may befal it.</p>

<p class='c008'>We can see no reason why a nurse, who conceals
any misfortune which happens to a child under her
care, till it loses its life or limbs, should not be
punished. A few examples of this would save the
lives of many infants; but as there is little reason
to expect that it ever will be the case, we would
earnestly recommend it to all parents to look carefully
after their children, and not to trust so valuable
a treasure entirely in the hands of an hireling.</p>

<p class='c008'>No person ought to imagine these things unworthy
of his attention. On the proper management
of children depend not only their health and
usefulness in life, but likewise the safety and prosperity
of the state to which they belong. Effeminacy
ever will prove the ruin of any state where it
prevails; and, when its foundations are laid in infancy,
it can never afterwards be wholly eradicated.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Parents who love their offspring, and wish well to
their country, ought therefore, in the management
of their children, to avoid every thing that may
have a tendency to make them weak or effeminate,
and to take every method in their power to render
their constitutions strong and hardy.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. II.<br> <span class='c015'><span class='fss'>OF THE</span> LABORIOUS, <span class='fss'>THE</span> SEDENTARY, <span class='fss'>AND THE</span> STUDIOUS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>That men are exposed to particular diseases
from the occupations which they follow, is a
fact well known; but to remedy this evil is a matter
of some difficulty. Most people are under the
necessity of following those employments to which
they have been bred, whether they be favourable
to health or not. For this reason, instead of inveighing,
in a general way, as some authors have
done, against those occupations which are hurtful
to health, we shall endeavour to point out the circumstances
in each of them from which the danger
chiefly arises, and to propose the most rational methods
of preventing it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chymists, founders, forgers, glass-makers, and
several other artists, are hurt by the unwholesome
air which they are obliged to breathe. This air is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>not only loaded with the noxious exhalations arising
from metals and minerals, but is so charged with
phlogiston as to be rendered unfit for expanding
the lungs sufficiently, and answering the other important
purposes of respiration. Hence proceed
asthmas, coughs, and consumptions of the lungs,
so incident to persons who follow these employments.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent such consequences, as far as possible,
the places where these occupations are carried on,
ought to be constructed in such a manner as to discharge
the smoke and other exhalations, and admit
a free current of fresh air. Such artists ought never
to continue too long at work; and when they give
over, they should suffer themselves to cool gradually,
and put on their clothes before they go into
the open air. They ought never to drink large
quantities of cold, weak, or watery liquors, while
their bodies are hot, nor to indulge in raw fruits,
sallads, or any thing that is cold on the stomach<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c010'><sup>[22]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miners, and all who work under ground, are
likewise hurt by unwholesome air. The air, by its
stagnation in deep mines, not only loses its proper
spring and other qualities necessary for respiration,
but is often loaded with such noxious exhalations as
to become a most deadly poison.</p>

<p class='c008'>The two kinds of air which prove most destructive
to miners, are what they call the <i>fire damp</i>, and
the <i>choke damp</i>. In both cases the air becomes a
poison, by its being loaded with phlogiston. The
danger from the former may be obviated by making
it explode before it accumulates in too great quantities;
and the latter may be generally carried off
by promoting a free circulation of air in the mine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Miners are not only hurt by unwholesome air,
but likewise by the particles of metal which adhere
to their skin, clothes, &#38;c. These are absorbed, or
taken up into the body, and occasion palsies, vertigoes,
and other nervous affections, which often
prove fatal. Fallopius observes, that those who
work in mines of mercury seldom live above three
or four years. Lead, and several other metals, are
likewise very pernicious to the health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Miners ought never to go to work fasting, nor
to continue too long at work. Their food ought
to be nourishing, and their liquor generous: nothing
more certainly hurts them than living too
low. They should by all means avoid costiveness.
This may either be done by chewing a little rhubarb,
or taking a sufficient quantity of sallad oil.
Oil not only opens the body, but sheaths and defends
the intestines from the ill effects of the metals.
All who work in mines or metals ought to
wash carefully, and to change their clothes as soon
as they give over working. Nothing would tend
more to preserve the health of such people than a
strict, and almost religious regard to cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Plumbers, painters, gilders, smelters, makers of
white lead, and many others who work in metals,
are liable to the same diseases as miners, and ought
to observe the same directions for avoiding them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Tallow-chandlers, boilers of oil, and all who
work in putrid animal substances, are likewise liable
to suffer from the unwholesome smells or effluvia of
these bodies. They ought to pay the same regard to
cleanliness as miners; and when they are affected
with nausea, sickness, or indigestion, we would advise
them to take a vomit or a gentle purge. Such substances
ought always to be manufactured as soon as
possible. When long kept, they not only become
unwholesome to those who manufacture them, but
likewise to people who live in the neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>It would greatly exceed the limits of this part of
our subject, to specify the diseases peculiar to persons
of every occupation; we shall therefore consider mankind
under the general classes of <i>Laborious</i>,
<i>Sedentary</i>, and <i>Studious</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE LABORIOUS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though those who follow laborious employments
are in general the most healthy of mankind, yet the
nature of their occupations, and the places where
they are carried on, expose them more particularly
to some diseases. Husbandmen, for example, are exposed
to all the vicissitudes of the weather, which, in
this country, are often very great and sudden, and
occasion colds, coughs, quinsies, rheumatisms, fevers,
and other acute disorders. They are likewise
forced to work hard, and often to carry burdens
above their strength, which, by overstraining the
vessels, occasion asthmas, ruptures, pleurisies, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who labour without doors are often afflicted
with intermitting fevers or agues, occasioned
by the frequent vicissitudes of heat and cold, poor
living, bad water, sitting or lying on the damp
ground, evening dews, night air, &#38;c. to which
they are frequently exposed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as bear heavy burdens, as porters, labourers,
&#38;c. are obliged to draw in the air with much greater
force, and also to keep their lungs distended with
more violence than is necessary for common respiration:
by this means the tender vessels of the lungs
are overstretched, and often burst, insomuch that a
spitting of blood or fever ensues. Hippocrates mentions
an instance to this purpose, of a man, who, upon
a wager, carried an ass; but was soon after seized
with a fever, a vomiting of blood, and a rupture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Carrying heavy burdens is generally the effect of
mere laziness, which prompts people to do at once
what should be done at twice. Sometimes it proceeds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>from vanity or emulation. Hence it is, that the
strongest men are most commonly hurt by heavy burdens,
hard labour, or feats of activity. It is rare to
find one who boasts of his strength without a rupture,
a spitting of blood, or some other disease, which he
reaps as the fruit of his folly. One would imagine,
the daily instances we have, of the fatal effects of carrying
great weights, running, wrestling, and the like,
would be sufficient to prevent such practices.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are indeed some employments which necessarily
require a great exertion of strength, as
porters, blacksmiths, carpenters, &#38;c. None ought
to follow these but men of strong body; and they
should never exert their strength to the utmost, nor
work too long. When the muscles are violently
strained, frequent rest is necessary, in order that
they may recover their tone; without this, the
strength and constitution will soon be worn out, and
a premature old age be induced.</p>

<p class='c008'>The erysipelas, or St. Anthony’s fire, is a disease
very incident to the laborious. It is occasioned by
whatever gives a sudden check to the perspiration,
as drinking cold water when the body is warm, wet
feet, keeping on wet clothes, sitting or lying on
the damp ground, &#38;c. It is impossible for those
who labour without doors always to guard against
these inconveniences; but it is known from experience,
that their ill consequences might often be
prevented by proper care.</p>

<p class='c008'>The iliac passion, the cholic, and other complaints
of the bowels, are often occasioned by the same causes
as the erysipelas; but they may likewise proceed from
flatulent and indigestible food. Labourers generally
eat unfermented bread, made of peas, beans, rye,
and other windy ingredients. They also devour great
quantities of unripe fruits, baked, stewed, or raw,
with various kinds of roots and herbs, upon which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>they often drink sour milk, stale small beer, or the
like. Such a mixture cannot fail to fill the bowels
with wind, and occasion diseases of those parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inflammations, whitloes, and other diseases of
the extremities, are likewise common among those
who labour without doors. These diseases are often
attributed to venom, or some kind of poison; but
they generally proceed either from sudden heat after
cold, or the contrary. When labourers, milk-maids,
&#38;c. come from the field, cold or wet, they run to
the fire, and often plunge their hands in warm water,
by which means the blood and other humours in
those parts are suddenly expanded, and, the vessels
not yielding so quickly, a strangulation happens,
and an inflammation or a mortification ensues.</p>

<p class='c008'>When such persons come home cold, they ought
to keep at a distance from the fire for some time, to
wash their hands in cold water, and to rub them well
with a dry cloth. It sometimes happens, that people
are so benumbed with cold, as to be quite deprived
of the use of their limbs. In this case, the only remedy
is to rub the parts affected with snow, or,
where it cannot be had, with cold water. If they be
held near the fire, or plunged into warm water, a
mortification will generally ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Labourers in the hot season are apt to lie down,
and sleep in the sun. This practice is so dangerous,
that they often wake in a burning fever. These ardent
fevers, which prove so fatal about the end of
summer and beginning of autumn, are frequently
occasioned by this means. When labourers leave
off work, which they ought always to do during the
heat of the day, they should go home, or, at least,
get under some cover, where they may repose themselves
in safety.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people follow their employments in the
fields from morning till night, without eating any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>thing. This cannot fail to hurt their health. However
homely their fare be, they ought to have it at
regular times; and the harder they work, the more
frequently they should eat. If the humours be not
frequently replenished with fresh nourishment, they
soon become putrid, and produce fevers of the very
worst kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many peasants are extremely careless with respect
to what they eat or drink, and often, through mere
indolence, use unwholesome food, when they might
for the same expence have that which is wholesome.
In some parts of Britain, the peasants are too careless
even to take the trouble of dressing their own
victuals. Such people would live upon one meal
a day in indolence, rather than labour, though it
were to procure them the greatest affluence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fevers of a very bad kind are often occasioned
among labourers by <i>poor living</i>. When the body is
not sufficiently nourished, the humours become vitiated,
and the solids weak; from whence the most
fatal consequences ensue. <i>Poor living</i> is likewise
productive of many of those cutaneous diseases so
frequent among the lower class of people. It is remarkable
that cattle, when pinched in their food,
are generally affected with diseases of the skin, which
seldom fail to disappear, when they are put upon a
good pasture. This shews how much a good state
of the humours depends upon a sufficient quantity
of proper nourishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poverty not only occasions, but aggravates, many
of the diseases of the laborious. Few of them have
much foresight; and, if they had, it is seldom in
their power to save any thing. They are glad to
make a shift to live from day to day; and, when any
disease overtakes them, they are miserable indeed.
Here the godlike virtue of charity ought always to
exert itself. To relieve the industrious poor in distress,
is surely the most exalted act of religion and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>humanity. They alone, who are witnesses of those
scenes of calamity, can form a notion of what numbers
perish in diseases, for want of proper assistance,
and even for want of the necessaries of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Labourers are often hurt by a foolish emulation,
which prompts them to vie with one another, till
they overheat themselves to such a degree as to occasion
a fever, or even to drop down dead. Such as
wantonly throw away their lives in this manner, deserve
to be looked upon in no better light than self-murderers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The office of a <i>soldier</i>, in time of war, may be
ranked among the laborious employments. Soldiers
suffer many hardships from the inclemency of seasons,
long marches, bad provisions, hunger, watching, unwholesome
climates, bad water, &#38;c. These occasion
fevers, fluxes, rheumatisms, and other fatal diseases,
which generally do greater execution than the sword,
especially when campaigns are continued too late in
the season. A few weeks of cold rainy weather will
often prove more fatal than an engagement.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have the command of armies should
take care that their soldiers be well clothed and well
fed. They ought also to finish their campaigns in
due season, and to provide their men with dry and
well-aired winter quarters. These rules, taking
care, at the same time, to keep the sick at a proper
distance from those in health, would tend greatly
to preserve the lives of the soldiery<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c010'><sup>[23]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Sailors may also be numbered among the laborious.
They undergo great hardships from change
of climate, the violence of weather, hard labour,
bad provisions, &#38;c. Sailors are of so great importance
both to the trade and safety of this kingdom,
that too much pains can never be bestowed in
pointing out the means of preserving their lives.</p>

<p class='c008'>One great source of the diseases of sea-faring
people is excess. When they get on shore, after
having been long at sea, without regard to the climate,
or their own constitutions, they plunge headlong
into all manner of riot, and often persist till a
fever puts an end to their lives. Thus intemperance,
and not the climate, is often the cause why
so many of our brave sailors die on foreign coasts.
Such people ought not to live too low; but they
will find moderation the best defence against fevers,
and many other maladies.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sailors, when on duty, cannot avoid sometimes
getting wet. When this happens, they should change
their clothes as soon as they are relieved, and take
every method to restore the perspiration. They
should not, in this case, make too free with spirits
or other strong liquors, but should rather drink
them diluted with warm water, and go immediately
to bed, where a sound sleep and a gentle sweat
would set all to rights.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the health of sailors suffers most from unwholesome
food. The constant use of salted provisions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>vitiates their humours, and occasions the
scurvy, and other obstinate maladies. It is no easy
matter to prevent this disease in long voyages; yet
we cannot help thinking, that much might be done
towards effecting so desirable an end, were due pains
bestowed for that purpose. For example, various
roots, greens, and fruits, might be kept a long
time at sea, as onions, potatoes, cabbages, lemons,
oranges, tamarinds, apples, &#38;c. When fruits
cannot be kept, the juices of them, either fresh or
fermented, may. With these all the drink, and
even the food of the ship’s company, ought to be
acidulated in long voyages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Stale bread and beer likewise contribute to vitiate
the humours. Flour will keep for a long time on
board, of which fresh bread might frequently be
made. Malt too might be kept, and infused with
boiling water at any time. This liquor, when drank
even in form of wort, is very wholesome, and is
found to be an antidote against the scurvy. Small
wines and cyder might likewise be plentifully laid
in; and should they turn sour, they would still be
useful as vinegar. Vinegar is a great antidote
against diseases, and should be used by all travellers,
especially at sea. It may either be mixed with the
water they drink, or taken in their food.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such animals as can be kept alive, ought likewise
to be carried on board, as hens, ducks, pigs, &#38;c.
Fresh broths made of portable soup, and puddings
made of peas, or other vegetables, ought to be
used plentifully. Many other things will readily
occur to people conversant in these matters, which
would tend to preserve the health of that brave and
useful set of men<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c010'><sup>[24]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>We have reason to believe, if due attention were
paid to the diet, air, clothing, and above all things
to the cleanliness of sea-faring people, they would be
the most healthy set of men in the world; but when
these are neglected, the very reverse will happen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best <i>medical antidote</i> that we can recommend
to sailors or soldiers, on foreign coasts, especially
where dampness prevails, is the Peruvian bark.
This will often prevent fevers, and other fatal diseases.
About a drachm of it may be chewed every
day; or if this should prove disagreeable, an ounce
of bark, with half an ounce of orange peel, and two
drachms of snake-root coarsely powdered, may be
infused for two or three days in an English quart of
brandy, and half a wine glass of it taken twice or
thrice a-day, when the stomach is empty. This has
been found to be an excellent antidote against fluxes,
putrid, intermitting, and other fevers, in unhealthy
climates. It is not material in what form this medicine
is taken. It may either be infused in water,
wine, or spirits, as recommended above, or made
into an electuary with syrup of lemons, oranges, or
the like.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE SEDENTARY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though nothing can be more contrary to the
nature of man than a sedentary life, yet this class
comprehends by far the greater part of the species.
Almost the whole female world, and in manufacturing
countries, the major part of the males, may
be reckoned sedentary<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c010'><sup>[25]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Agriculture, the first and most healthful of all
employments, is now followed by few who are able
to carry on any other business. But those who imagine
that the culture of the earth is not sufficient to
employ all its inhabitants are greatly mistaken.
An ancient Roman, we are told, could maintain
his family from the produce of one acre of ground.
So might a modern Briton, if he would be contented
to live like a Roman. This shews what an
immense increase of inhabitants Britain might admit
of, and all of them live by the culture of the
ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Agriculture is the great source of domestic riches.
Where it is neglected, whatever wealth may be imported
from abroad, poverty and misery will abound
at home. Such is, and ever will be, the fluctuating
state of trade and manufactures, that thousands
of people may be in full employment to-day,
and in beggary to-morrow. This can never happen
to those who cultivate the ground. They can
eat the fruit of their labour, and can always by
industry obtain, at least, the necessaries of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though sedentary employments are necessary,
yet there seems to be no reason why any person
should be confined for life to these alone. Were
such employments intermixed with the more active
and laborious, they would never do hurt. It is
constant confinement that ruins the health. A man
may not be hurt by sitting five or six hours a-day;
but if he is obliged to sit ten or twelve, he will
soon become diseased.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it is not want of exercise alone which hurts
sedentary people; they likewise suffer from the confined
air which they breathe. It is very common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>to see ten or a dozen taylors<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c010'><sup>[26]</sup></a>, or staymakers, for
example, crowded into one small apartment, where
there is hardly room for one person to breathe
freely. In this situation they generally continue
for many hours at a time, often with the addition
of several candles, which tend likewise to waste the
air, and render it less fit for respiration. Air that
is breathed repeatedly becomes unfit for expanding
the lungs. This is one cause of the phthisical
coughs, and other complaints of the breath, so incident
to sedentary artificers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the perspiration from a great number of
persons pent up together, renders the air unwholesome.
The danger from this quarter will be
greatly increased, if any one of them happens to
have bad lungs, or to be otherwise diseased.
Those who sit near him, being forced to breathe
the same air, can hardly fail to be infected. It
would be a rare thing, however, to find a dozen
of sedentary people all in good health. The danger
of crowding them together must therefore be
evident to every one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many of those who follow sedentary employments
are constantly in a bending posture, as shoemakers,
taylors, cutlers, &#38;c. Such a situation is
extremely hurtful. A bending posture obstructs all
the vital motions, and of course must destroy the
health. Accordingly we find such artificers generally
complaining of indigestions, flatulencies,
head-achs, pains of the breast, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>The aliment in sedentary people, instead of being
pushed forwards by an erect posture, and the
action of the muscles, is in a manner confined
in the bowels. Hence indigestions, costiveness,
wind, and other hypochondriacal affections, the
constant companions of the sedentary. Indeed
none of the excretions can be duly performed
where exercise is wanting; and when the matter
which ought to be discharged in this way is retained
too long in the body, it must have bad
effects, as it is again taken up into the mass of humours.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bending posture is likewise hurtful to the
lungs. When this organ is compressed, the air
cannot have free access into all its parts, so as to
expand them properly. Hence tubercles, adhesions,
&#38;c. are formed, which often end in consumptions.
Besides, the proper action of the lungs
being absolutely necessary for making good blood,
when that organ fails, the humours soon become
universally depraved, and the whole constitution
goes to wreck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sedentary artificers are not only hurt by pressure
on the bowels, but also on the inferior extremities,
which obstructs the circulation in these parts,
and renders them weak and feeble. Thus taylors,
shoemakers, &#38;c. frequently lose the use of their
legs altogether: besides, the blood and humours
are, by stagnation, vitiated, and the perspiration is
obstructed: from whence proceed the scab, ulcerous
sores, foul blotches, and other cutaneous diseases,
so common among sedentary artificers.</p>

<p class='c008'>A bad figure of body is a very common consequence
of close application to sedentary employments.
The spine, for example, by being continually
bent, puts on a crooked shape, and generally
remains so ever after. But a bad figure of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>body has already been observed to be hurtful to
health, as the vital functions are thereby impeded.</p>

<p class='c008'>A sedentary life seldom fails to occasion an universal
relaxation of the solids. This is the great
source from whence most of the diseases of sedentary
people flow. The scrophula, consumption,
hysterics, and nervous diseases, now so common,
were very little known in this country before sedentary
artificers became so numerous: and they are
very little known still among such of our people as
follow active employments without doors, though
in great towns at least two-thirds of the inhabitants
are afflicted with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very difficult to remedy those evils, because
many who have been accustomed to a sedentary
life, like rickety children, lose all inclination for
exercise; we shall, however, throw out a few
hints with respect to the most likely means for preserving
the health of this useful set of people,
which some of them, we hope, will be wise enough
to take.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been already observed, that sedentary artificers
are often hurt by their bending posture.
They ought therefore to stand or sit as erect as the
nature of their employments will permit. They
should likewise change their posture frequently,
and should never sit too long at a time, but leave
off work, and walk, ride, run, or do any thing that
will promote the vital functions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sedentary artificers are generally allowed too
little time for exercise; yet, short as it is, they seldom
employ it properly. A journeyman taylor or
weaver, for example, instead of walking abroad for
exercise and fresh air, at his hours of leisure, chuses
often to spend them in a public-house, or in playing
at some sedentary game, by which he generally
loses both his time and his money.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>The awkward postures in which many sedentary
artificers work, seem rather to be the effect of custom
than necessity. For example, a table might
surely be contrived for ten or a dozen taylors to sit
round, with liberty for their legs either to hang
down, or rest upon a foot-board, as they should
chuse. A place might likewise be cut out for each
person, in such a manner that he might sit as conveniently
for working as in the present mode of
sitting cross-legged.</p>

<p class='c008'>All sedentary artificers ought to pay the most religious
regard to cleanliness. Both their situation
and occupations render this highly necessary. Nothing
would contribute more to preserve their
health, than a strict attention to it; and such of
them as neglect it, not only run the hazard of
losing health, but of becoming a nuisance to their
neighbours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sedentary people ought to avoid food that is
windy, or hard of digestion, and should pay the
strictest regard to sobriety. A person who works
hard without doors will soon throw off a debauch;
but one who sits has by no means an equal chance.
Hence it often happens, that sedentary people are
seized with fevers after hard drinking. When such
persons feel their spirits low, instead of running to
the tavern for relief, they should ride, or walk in
the fields. This would remove the complaint more
effectually than strong liquor, and would never hurt
the constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of multiplying rules for preserving the
health of the sedentary, we shall recommend to them
the following general plan, viz. That every person
who follows a sedentary employment should cultivate
a piece of ground with his own hands. This
he might dig, plant, sow, and weed at leisure
hours, so as to make it both an exercise and amusement,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>while it produced many of the necessaries of
life. After working an hour in a garden, a man
will return with more keenness to his employment
within doors, than if he had been all the while
idle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Labouring the ground is every way conducive to
health. It not only gives exercise to every part
of the body, but the very smell of the earth and
fresh herbs revives and cheers the spirits, whilst the
perpetual prospect of something coming to maturity,
delights and entertains the mind. We are so
formed as to be always pleased with somewhat in
prospect, however distant or however trivial. Hence
the happiness that most men feel in planting, sowing,
building, &#38;c. These seem to have been the
chief employments of the more early ages: and,
when kings and conquerors cultivated the ground,
there is reason to believe that they knew as well
wherein true happiness consisted as we do.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may seem romantic to recommend gardening
to manufacturers in great towns; but observation
proves that the plan is very practicable. In the
town of Sheffield, in Yorkshire, where the great
iron manufacture is carried on, there is hardly a
journeyman cutler who does not possess a piece of
ground, which he cultivates as a garden. This
practice has many salutary effects. It not only induces
these people to take exercise without doors,
but also to eat many greens, roots, &#38;c. of their
own growth, which they would never think of purchasing.
There can be no reason why manufacturers
in any other town in Great Britain should not
follow the same plan. It is indeed to be regretted,
that in such a place as London a plan of this kind
is not practicable; yet even there sedentary artificers
may find opportunities of taking air and exercise,
if they chuse to embrace them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>Mechanics are too much inclined to crowd into
great towns. The situation may have some advantages;
but it has likewise many disadvantages. All
mechanics who live in the country have it in their
power to cultivate a piece of ground; which indeed
most of them do. This not only gives them exercise,
but enables them to live more comfortably.
So far at least as my observation extends, mechanics
who live in the country are far more happy
than those in great towns. They enjoy better
health, live in greater affluence, and seldom fail to
rear a healthy and numerous offspring.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a word, exercise without doors, in one shape
or another, is absolutely necessary to health. Those
who neglect it, though they may for a while drag
out life, can hardly be said to enjoy it. Weak and
effeminate, they languish for a few years, and soon
drop into an untimely grave.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>THE STUDIOUS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Intense thinking is so destructive to health, that
few instances can be produced of studious persons
who are strong and healthy. Hard study always
implies a sedentary life; and when intense thinking
is joined to the want of exercise, the consequences
must be bad. We have frequently known even a
few months of close application to study ruin an
excellent constitution, by inducing a train of nervous
complaints which could never be removed.
Man is evidently not formed for continual thought
more than for perpetual action, and would be as
soon worn out by the one as by the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>So great is the power of the mind over the body,
that, by its influence, the whole vital motions may
be accelerated or retarded, to almost any degree.
Thus cheerfulness and mirth quicken the circulation,
and promote all the secretions; whereas sadness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>and profound thought never fail to retard
them. Hence it would appear, that even a degree
of thoughtlessness is necessary to health. Indeed,
the perpetual thinker seldom enjoys either health
or spirits; while the person, who can hardly be
said to think at all, generally enjoys both.</p>

<p class='c008'>Perpetual thinkers, as they are called, seldom
think long. In a few years they generally become
quite stupid, and exhibit a melancholy proof how
readily the greatest blessings may be abused.
Thinking, like every thing else, when carried to
extreme, becomes a vice: nor can any thing afford
a greater proof of wisdom, than for a man frequently
and reasonably to unbend his mind. This
may generally be done by mixing in cheerful company,
active diversions, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of attempting to investigate the nature
of that connection which subsists between the mind
and body, or to inquire into the manner in which
they mutually affect each other, we shall only mention
those diseases to which the learned are more
peculiarly liable, and endeavour to point out the
means of avoiding them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Studious persons are very subject to the gout.
This painful disease in a great measure proceeds
from indigestion, and an obstructed perspiration.
It is impossible that the man who sits from morning
till night should either digest his food, or have any
of the secretions in due quantity. But when that
matter, which should be thrown off by the skin, is
retained in the body, and the humours are not duly
prepared, diseases must ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>The studious are likewise very liable to the stone
and gravel. Exercise greatly promotes both the
secretion and discharge of urine; consequently a
sedentary life must have the contrary effect. Any
one may be satisfied of this by observing, that he
passes much more urine by day than in the night,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>and also when he walks or rides, than when he
sits.</p>

<p class='c008'>The circulation in the liver being flow, obstructions
in that organ can hardly fail to be the consequence
of inactivity. Hence sedentary people are
frequently afflicted with schirrous livers. But the
proper secretion and discharge of the bile is so necessary
a part of the animal œconomy, that where
these are not duly performed, the health must soon
be impaired. Jaundice, indigestion, loss of appetite,
and a wasting of the whole body, seldom fail
to be the consequences of a vitiated state of the
liver, or obstructions of the bile.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few diseases prove more fatal to the studious than
consumptions of the lungs. It has already been observed,
that this organ cannot be duly expanded in
those who do not take proper exercise; and where
that is the case, obstructions and adhesions will ensue.
Not only want of exercise, but the posture
in which studious persons generally sit, is very
hurtful to the lungs. Those who read or write
much are ready to contract a habit of bending forwards,
and often press with their breast upon a
table or bench. This posture cannot fail to hurt
the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The functions of the heart may likewise by this
means be injured. I remember to have seen a man
opened, whose pericardium adhered to the breast-bone
in such a manner as to obstruct the motion of
the heart, and occasion his death. The only probable
cause that could be assigned for this singular
symptom was, that the man, whose business was
writing, used constantly to sit in a bending posture,
with his breast pressing upon the edge of a plain
table.</p>

<p class='c008'>No person can enjoy health who does not properly
digest his food. But intense thinking and
inactivity never fail to weaken the powers of digestion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Hence the humours become crude and
vitiated, the solids weak and relaxed, and the whole
constitution goes to ruin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long and intense thinking often occasions
grievous head-achs, which bring on vertigoes,
apoplexies, palsies, and other fatal disorders. The
best way to prevent these is, never to study too long
at one time, and to keep the body regular, either
by proper food, or taking frequently a little of
some opening medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who read or write much are often afflicted
with sore eyes. Studying by candle-light is peculiarly
hurtful to the sight. This ought to be practised
as seldom as possible. When it is unavoidable,
the eyes should be shaded, and the head
should not be held too low. When the eyes are
weak or painful, they should be bathed every night
and morning in cold water, to which a little brandy
may be added.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed, that the excretions
are very defective in the studious. The dropsy
is often occasioned by the retention of those humours
which ought to be carried off in this way.
Any person may observe, that sitting makes his
legs swell, and that this goes off by exercise;
which clearly points out the method of prevention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fevers, especially of the nervous kind, are often
the effect of study. Nothing affects the nerves so
much as intense thought. It in a manner unhinges
the whole human frame, and not only hurts the
vital motions, but disorders the mind itself. Hence
a delirium, melancholy, and even madness, are
often the effect of close application to study. In
fine, there is no disease which can proceed either
from a bad state of the humours, a defect of the
usual secretions, or a debility of the nervous system,
which may not be induced by intense thinking.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>But the most afflicting of all the diseases which
attack the studious is the hypochondriac. This
disease seldom fails to be the companion of deep
thought. It may rather be called a complication
of maladies than a single one. To what a wretched
condition are the best of men often reduced by it!
Their strength and appetite fail; a perpetual gloom
hangs over their minds; they live in the constant
dread of death, and are continually in search of relief
from medicine, where, alas! it is not to be
found. Those who labour under this disorder,
though they are often made the subject of ridicule,
justly claim our highest sympathy and compassion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hardly any thing can be more preposterous than
for a person to make study his sole business. A mere
student is seldom an useful member of society. He
often neglects the most important duties of life, in
order to pursue studies of a very trifling nature.
Indeed it rarely happens, that any useful invention
is the effect of mere study. The farther men dive
into profound researches, they generally deviate
the more from common sense, and too often lose
sight of it altogether. Profound speculations, instead
of making men wiser or better, generally render
them absolute sceptics, and overwhelm them
with doubt and uncertainty. All that is necessary
for man to know, in order to be happy, is easily
obtained; and the rest, like the forbidden fruit,
serves only to increase his misery.</p>

<p class='c008'>Studious persons, in order to relieve their minds,
must not only discontinue to read and write, but
engage in some employment or diversion, that will
so far occupy the thought as to make them forget
the business of the closet. A solitary ride or walk
are so far from relaxing the mind, that they rather
encourage thought. Nothing can divert the mind,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>when it gets into a train of serious thinking, but
attention to subjects of a more trivial nature.
These prove a kind of play to the mind, and consequently
relieve it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Learned men often contract a contempt for what
they call trifling company. They are ashamed to
be seen with any but philosophers. This however
is no proof of their being philosophers themselves.
No man deserves that name who is ashamed to unbend
his mind, by associating with the cheerful and
gay. Even the society of children will relieve the
mind, and expel the gloom which application to
study is too apt to occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>As studious people are necessarily much within
doors, they should make choice of a large and well-aired
place for study. This would not only prevent
the bad effects which attend confined air, but
would cheer the spirits, and have a most happy influence
both on the body and mind. It is said of
Euripides the tragedian, that he used to retire to a
dark cave to compose his tragedies, and of Demosthenes
the Grecian orator, that he chose a place
for study where nothing could be either heard or
seen. With all deference to such venerable names,
we cannot help condemning their taste. A man
may surely think to as good purpose in an elegant
apartment as in a cave; and may have as happy
conceptions where the all-cheering rays of the sun
render the air wholesome, as in places where they
never enter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who read or write much should be very
attentive to their posture. They ought to sit and
stand by turns, always keeping as nearly in an erect
posture as possible. Those who dictate, may do it
walking. It has an excellent effect frequently to
read or speak aloud. This not only exercises the
lungs, but almost the whole body. Hence studious
people are greatly benefited by delivering discourses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>in public. Public speakers, indeed, sometimes
hurt themselves by overacting their part; but
this is their own fault. The martyr to mere vociferation
merits not our sympathy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The morning has, by all medical writers, been
reckoned the best time for study. It is so. But it
is also the most proper season for exercise, while
the stomach is empty, and the spirits refreshed with
sleep. Studious people should therefore sometimes
spend the morning in walking, riding, or some
manly diversions without doors. This would make
them return to study with greater alacrity, and
would be of more service than twice the time after
their spirits are worn out with fatigue. It is not
sufficient to take diversion only when we can think
no longer. Every studious person should make it
a part of his business, and should let nothing interrupt
his hours of recreation more than those of
study.</p>

<p class='c008'>Music has a very happy effect in relieving the
mind when fatigued with study. It would be well
if every studious person were so far acquainted with
that science as to amuse himself after severe
thought, by playing such airs as have a tendency to
raise the spirits, and inspire cheerfulness and good
humour.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a reproach to Learning, that any of her
votaries, to relieve the mind after study, should betake
themselves to the use of strong liquors. This
indeed is a remedy; but it is a desperate one, and
always proves destructive. Would such persons,
when their spirits are low, get on horseback, and
ride ten or a dozen miles, they would find it a more
effectual remedy than any cordial medicine in the
apothecary’s shop, or all the strong liquors in the
world.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following is my plan, and I cannot recommend
a better to others. When my mind is fatigued
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>with study, or other serious business, I mount
my horse, and ride ten or twelve miles into the
country, where I spend a day, and sometimes two,
with a cheerful friend; after which I never fail to
return to town with new vigour, and to pursue my
studies or business with fresh alacrity.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is much to be regretted, that learned men,
while in health, pay so little regard to these things!
There is not any thing more common than to see a
miserable object over-run with nervous diseases,
bathing, walking, riding, and, in a word, doing
every thing for health after it is gone; yet, if any
one had recommended these things to him by way
of prevention, the advice would, in all probability,
have been treated with contempt, or, at least,
with neglect. Such is the weakness and folly of
mankind, and such the want of foresight, even in
those who ought to be wiser than others!</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the diet of the studious, we see
no reason why they should abstain from any kind of
food that is wholesome, provided they use it in
moderation. They ought, however, to be sparing
in the use of every thing that is windy, rancid, or
hard of digestion. Their suppers should always be
light, or taken soon in the evening. Their drink
may be water, fine malt liquor, not too strong,
good cyder, wine and water, or, if troubled with
acidities, water mixed with a little brandy, rum,
or any other genuine spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall only observe, with regard to those kinds
of exercise which are most proper for the studious,
that they should not be too violent, nor ever carried
to the degree of excessive fatigue. They
ought likewise to be frequently varied so as to give
action to all the different parts of the body; and
should, as often as possible, be taken in the open
air. In general, riding on horseback, walking,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>working in a garden, or playing at some active diversions,
are the best.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would likewise recommend the use of the
cold bath to the studious. It will, in some measure,
supply the place of exercise, and should not
be neglected by persons of a relaxed habit, especially
in the warm season.</p>

<p class='c008'>No person ought either to take violent exercise,
or to study immediately after a full meal.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. III.<br> <span class='c015'>OF ALIMENT.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Unwholesome food, and irregularities in
diet, occasion many diseases. There is no
doubt but the whole constitution of body may be
changed by diet alone. The fluids may be thereby
attenuated or condensed, rendered mild or acrimonious,
coagulated or diluted, to almost any degree.
Nor are its effects upon the solids less considerable.
They may be braced or relaxed, have their sensibility,
motions, &#38;c. greatly increased or diminished,
by different kinds of aliment. A very small attention
to these things will be sufficient to shew, how
much the preservation of health depends upon a
proper regimen of the diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is an attention to diet necessary for the preservation
of health only: it is likewise of importance
in the cure of diseases. Every intention in
the cure of many diseases, may be answered by diet
alone. Its effects, indeed, are not always so quick
as those of medicine, but they are generally more
lasting: besides, it is neither so disagreeable to the
patient, nor so dangerous as medicine, and is always
more easily obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>Our intention here is not to inquire minutely
into the nature and properties of the various kinds
of aliment in use among mankind; nor to shew their
effects upon the different constitutions of the human
body; but to mark some of the most pernicious errors
which people are apt to fall into, with respect
both to the quantity and qualities of their food,
and to point out their influence upon health.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not indeed an easy matter to ascertain the
exact quantity of food proper for every age, sex, and
constitution: but a scrupulous nicety here is by no
means necessary. The best rule is to avoid all
extremes. Mankind were never intended to weigh
and measure their food. Nature teaches every
creature when it has enough; and the calls of thirst
and hunger are sufficient to inform them when more
is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though <i>moderation</i> is the chief rule with regard
to the quantity, yet the quality of food merits a
farther consideration. There are many ways by
which provisions may be rendered unwholesome.
Bad seasons may either prevent the ripening of
grain, or damage it afterwards. These, indeed, are
acts of Providence, and we must submit to them;
but surely no punishment can be too severe for
those who suffer provisions to spoil by hoarding them,
on purpose to raise the price, or who promote their
own interest by adulterating the necessaries of life<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c010'><sup>[27]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Animal, as well as vegetable food, may be rendered
unwholesome, by being kept too long. All
animal substances have a constant tendency to putrefaction;
and, when that has proceeded too far, they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>not only become offensive to the senses, but hurtful
to health. Diseased animals, and such as die of
themselves, ought never to be eaten. It is a common
practice, however, in some grazing countries,
for servants and poor people to eat such animals as
die of any disease, or are killed by accident. Poverty,
indeed, may oblige people to do this; but
they had better eat a smaller quantity of what is
sound and wholesome: it would both afford a better
nourishment, and be attended with less danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The injunctions given to the Jews, not to eat
any creature which died of itself, seem to have a
strict regard to health; and ought to be observed
by Christians as well as Jews. Animals never die
themselves without some previous disease; but how
a diseased animal should be wholesome food, is inconceivable:
even those which die by accident must
be hurtful, as their blood is mixed with the flesh,
and soon turns putrid.</p>

<p class='c008'>Animals which feed grossly, as tame ducks, hogs,
&#38;c. are neither so easily digested, nor afford such
wholesome nourishment as others. No animal can
be wholesome which does not take sufficient exercise.
Most of our stalled cattle are crammed with
gross food, but not allowed exercise nor free air;
by which means they indeed grow fat, but their
juices not being properly prepared or assimilated,
remain crude, and occasion indigestions, gross humours,
and oppression of the spirits, in those who
feed upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Animals are often rendered unwholesome by being
overheated. Excessive heat causes a fever, exalts
the animal salts, and mixes the blood so intimately
with the flesh, that it cannot be separated. For this
reason, butchers should be severely punished who
over-drive their cattle. No person would chuse to
eat the flesh of an animal which had died in a high
fever; yet that is the case with all over-drove cattle;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and the fever is often raised even to the degree of
madness.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this is not the only way by which butchers
render meat unwholesome. The abominable custom
of filling the cellular membrane of animals with
air, in order to make them appear fat, is every day
practised. This not only spoils the meat, and renders
it unfit for keeping, but is such a dirty trick,
that the very idea of it is sufficient to disgust a person
of any delicacy at every thing which comes
from the shambles. Who can bear the thought of
eating meat which has been blown up with air from
the lungs of a dirty fellow, perhaps labouring under
the very worst of diseases?</p>

<p class='c008'>Butchers have likewise a method of filling the
cellular membranes of animals with blood. This
makes the meat seem fatter, and likewise weigh
more, but is notwithstanding a very pernicious custom,
as it both renders the meat unwholesome and
unfit for keeping. I seldom see a piece of meat
from the shambles, where the blood is not diffused
through the cellular texture. I shall not say that
this is always the effect of design; but I am certain
it is not the case with animals that are killed for
domestic use, and properly blooded. Veal seems
to be most frequently spoilt in this way. Perhaps
that may in some measure be owing to the practice
of carrying calves from a great distance to market,
by which means their tender flesh is bruised, and
many of their vessels burst.</p>

<p class='c008'>No people in the world eat such quantities of animal
food as the English, which is one reason why
they are so generally tainted with the scurvy and its
numerous train of consequences, indigestion, low
spirits, hypochondriacism, &#38;c. Animal food was
surely designed for man, and, with a proper mixture
of vegetables, it will be found the most wholesome;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>but to gorge beef, mutton, pork, fish, and fowl,
twice or thrice a day, is certainly too much. All
who value health ought to be contented with making
one meal of flesh in the twenty-four hours, and
this ought to consist of one kind only.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most obstinate scurvy has often been cured
by a vegetable diet; nay, milk alone will frequently
do more in that disease than any medicine. Hence
it is evident, that if vegetables and milk were more
used in diet, we should have less scurvy, and likewise
fewer putrid and inflammatory fevers. Fresh
vegetables, indeed, come to be daily more used in
diet; this laudable practice we hope will continue
to gain ground.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our aliment ought neither to be too moist nor
too dry. Moist aliment relaxes the solids, and renders
the body feeble. Thus we see females, who
live much on tea and other watery diet, generally
become weak, and unable to digest solid food:
hence proceed hysterics, and all their dreadful consequences.
On the other hand, food that is too dry,
renders the solids in a manner rigid, and the humours
viscid, which disposes the body to inflammatory
fevers, scurvies, and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much has been said on the ill effects of tea in diet.
They are, no doubt, numerous; but they proceed
rather from the imprudent use of it, than from any
bad qualities in the tea itself. Tea is now the universal
breakfast in this part of the world; but the
morning is surely the most improper time of the day
for drinking it. Most delicate persons, who, by
the bye, are the greatest tea-drinkers, cannot eat
any thing in the morning. If such persons, after
fasting ten or twelve hours, drink four or five cups
of tea without eating almost any bread, it must hurt
them. Good tea, taken in moderate quantity, not
too strong, nor too hot, nor drank upon an empty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>stomach, will seldom do harm; but if it be bad,
which is often the case, or substituted in the room
of solid food, it must have many ill effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>The arts of cookery render many things unwholesome,
which are not so in their own nature. By
jumbling together a number of different ingredients,
in order to make a poignant sauce or rich
soup, the composition proves almost a poison. All
high seasoning, pickles, &#38;c. are only incentives to
luxury, and never fail to hurt the stomach. It were
well for mankind, if cookery, as an art, were entirely
prohibited. Plain roasting or boiling is all
that the stomach requires. These alone are sufficient
for people in health, and the sick have still
less need of a cook.</p>

<p class='c008'>The liquid part of our aliment likewise claims our
attention. Water is not only the basis of most liquors,
but also composes a great part of our solid
food. Good water must therefore be of the greatest
importance in diet. The best water is that which
is most pure, and free from any mixture of foreign
bodies. Water takes up parts of most bodies with
which it comes into contact; by this means it is
often impregnated with metals or minerals of a
hurtful or poisonous nature. Hence the inhabitants
of some hilly countries have peculiar diseases, which
in all probability proceed from the water. Thus
the people who live near the Alps in Switzerland,
and the inhabitants of the Peak of Derby in England,
have large tumours or wens on their necks.
This disease is generally imputed to the snow water;
but there is more reason to believe it is owing to
the minerals in the mountains through which the
waters pass.</p>

<p class='c008'>When water is impregnated with foreign bodies,
it generally appears by its weight, colour, taste,
smell, heat, or some other sensible quality. Our
business therefore is to chuse such water, for common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>use, as is lightest, and without any particular
colour, taste, or smell. In most places of Britain
the inhabitants have it in their power to make choice
of their water; and few things would contribute
more to health than a due attention to this article.
But mere indolence often induces people to make
use of the water that is nearest to them, without
considering its qualities.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before water is brought into great towns, the
strictest attention ought to be paid to its qualities, as
many diseases may be occasioned or aggravated by
bad water; and when once it has been procured at
a great expence, people are unwilling to give it up.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common methods of rendering water clear
by filtration, or soft, by exposing it to the sun and
air, &#38;c. are so generally known, that it is unnecessary
to spend time in explaining them. We shall only,
in general, advise all to avoid waters which stagnate
long in small lakes, ponds, or the like, as such
waters often become putrid, by the corruption of
animal and vegetable bodies with which they
abound. Even cattle frequently suffer by drinking,
in dry seasons, water which has stood long in small
reservoirs, without being supplied by springs, or
freshened with showers. All wells ought to be kept
clean, and to have a free communication with the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>As fermented liquors, notwithstanding they have
been exclaimed against by many writers, still continue
to be the common drink of almost every person
who can afford them; we shall rather endeavour
to assist people in the choice of these liquors,
than pretend to condemn what custom has so firmly
established. It is not the moderate use of sound
fermented liquors which hurts mankind: it is excess,
and using such as are ill prepared or vitiated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fermented liquors, which are too strong, hurt
digestion; and the body is so far from being strengthened
by them, that it is weakened and relaxed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Many imagine that hard labour could not be supported
without drinking strong liquors: this is a
very erroneous notion. Men who never taste strong
liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue,
but also live much longer, than those who use them
daily. But, suppose strong liquors did enable a
man to do more work, they must nevertheless waste
the powers of life, and occasion premature old age.
They keep up a constant fever, which exhausts the
spirits, inflames the blood, and disposes the body
to numberless diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>But fermented liquors may be too weak as well
as too strong: when that is the case, they must either
be drank new, or they become sour and dead:
when such liquors are drank new, the fermentation
not being over, they generate air in the bowels, and
occasion flatulencies; and, when kept till stale,
they turn sour on the stomach, and hurt digestion.
For this reason all malt liquors, cider, &#38;c. ought
to be of such strength as to keep till they be ripe,
and then they should be used. When such liquors
are kept too long, though they should not become
sour, yet they generally contract a hardness, which
renders them unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>All families, who can, ought to prepare their
own liquors. Since preparing and vending of liquors
became one of the most general branches of
business, every method has been tried to adulterate
them. The great object both to the makers
and venders of liquor is, to render it intoxicating,
and give it the appearance of age. But it is well
known that this may be done by other ingredients
than those which ought to be used for making it
strong. It would be imprudent even to name those
things which are daily made use of to render liquors
heady. Suffice it to say, that the practice is
very common, and that all the ingredients used
for this purpose are of a narcotic or stupefactive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>quality. But as all opiates are poisonous, it is easy
to see what must be the consequence of their general
use. Though they do not kill suddenly, yet
they hurt the nerves, relax and weaken the stomach,
and spoil the digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Were fermented liquors faithfully prepared, kept
to a proper age, and used in moderation, they
would prove real blessings to mankind. But, while
they are ill prepared, various ways adulterated, and
taken to excess, they must have many pernicious
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would recommend it to families, not only to
prepare their own liquors, but likewise their bread.
Bread is so necessary a part of diet, that too much
care cannot be bestowed in order to have it sound
and wholesome. For this purpose, it is not only
necessary that it be made of good grain, but likewise
properly prepared, and kept free from all unwholesome
ingredients. This, however, we have
reason to believe is not always the case with bread
prepared by those who make a trade of vending it.
Their object is rather to please the eye, than to
consult the health. The best bread is that which
is neither too coarse nor too fine; well fermented
and made of wheat flour, or rather of wheat and
rye mixed together.</p>

<p class='c008'>To specify the different kinds of aliment, to explain
their nature and properties, and to point out
their effects in different constitutions, would far
exceed the limits of our design. Instead of a detail
of this kind, which would not be generally understood,
and of course little attended to, we shall
only mention the following easy rules with respect
to the choice of aliment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons, whose solids are weak and relaxed,
ought to avoid all viscid food, or such things as are
hard of digestion. Their diet, however, ought to
be nourishing; and they should take sufficient exercise
in the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>Such as abound with blood should be sparing in
the use of every thing that is highly nourishing, as
fat meat, rich wines, strong ale, and such like.
Their food should consist chiefly of bread and other
vegetable substances; and their drink ought to be
water, whey, or small beer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fat people should not eat freely of oily nourishing
diet. They ought frequently to use raddish,
garlic, spices, or such things as are heating and
promote perspiration and urine. Their drink should
be water, coffee, tea, or the like; and they ought
to take much exercise and little sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are too lean must follow an opposite
course.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as are troubled with acidities, or whose
food is apt to sour on the stomach, should live
much on animal food; and those who are afflicted
with hot alkaline eructations, ought to use a diet
consisting chiefly of acid vegetables.</p>

<p class='c008'>People who are affected with the gout, low spirits,
hypochondriac or hysteric disorders, ought to
avoid all flatulent food, every thing that is viscid,
or hard of digestion, all salted or smoke-dried provisions,
and whatever is austere, acid, or apt to
turn sour on the stomach. Their food should be
light, spare, cool, and of an opening nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet ought not only to be suited to the age
and constitution, but also to the manner of life: a
sedentary or studious person should live more sparingly
than one who labours hard without doors.
Many kinds of food will nourish a peasant very
well which would be almost indigestible to a citizen;
and the latter will live upon a diet on which
the former would starve.</p>

<p class='c008'>Diet ought not to be too uniform. The constant
use of one kind of food might have some bad effects.
Nature teaches us this, by the great variety
of aliment which she has provided for man, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>likewise by giving him an appetite for different
kinds of food.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who labour under any particular disease,
ought to avoid such aliments as have a tendency to
increase it: for example, a gouty person should
not indulge in rich wines, strong soups, or gravies,
and should avoid all acids. One who is troubled
with the gravel ought to shun all austere and
astringent aliments; and those who are scorbutic
should be sparing in the use of salted provisions,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first period of life, our food ought to be
light, but nourishing, and frequently taken. Food
that is solid, with a sufficient degree of tenacity, is
most proper for the state of manhood. The diet
suited to the last period of life, when nature is
upon the decline, approaches nearly to that of the
first. It should be lighter and more succulent than
that of vigorous age, and likewise more frequently
taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not only necessary for health that our diet be
wholesome, but also that it be taken at regular periods.
Some imagine long fasting will atone for
excess; but this, instead of mending the matter,
generally makes it worse. When the stomach and
intestines are over-distended with food, they lose
their proper tone, and, by long fasting, they become
weak, and inflated with wind. Thus, either
gluttony or fasting destroys the powers of digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The frequent repetition of aliment is not only
necessary for repairing the continual waste of our
bodies, but likewise to keep the fluids sound and
sweet. Our humours, even in the most healthy
state, have a constant tendency to putrefaction,
which can only be prevented by frequent supplies
of fresh nourishment: when that is wanting too
long, the putrefaction often proceeds so far as to
occasion very dangerous fevers. From hence we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>may learn the necessity of regular meals. No person
can enjoy a good state of health, whose vessels
are either frequently overcharged, or the humours
long deprived of fresh supplies of chyle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Long fasting is extremely hurtful to young people;
it not only vitiates their humours, but prevents
their growth. Nor is it less injurious to the
aged. Most persons, in the decline of life, are
afflicted with wind: this complaint is not only increased,
but even rendered dangerous, and often
fatal, by long fasting. Old people, when their
stomachs are empty, are frequently seized with giddiness,
head-achs, and faintness. These complaints
may generally be removed by a piece of
bread and a glass of wine, or taking any other solid
food; which plainly points out the method of preventing
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is more than probable, that many of the sudden
deaths, which happen in the advanced periods
of life, are occasioned by fasting too long, as it
exhausts the spirits, and fills the bowels with wind;
we would therefore advise people, in the decline
of life, never to allow their stomachs to be too long
empty. Many people take nothing but a few
cups of tea and a little bread, from nine o’clock at
night till two or three next afternoon. Such may
be said to fast almost three-fourths of their time.
This can hardly fail to ruin the appetite, vitiate
the humours, and fill the bowels with wind;
all which might be prevented by a solid breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a very common practice to eat a light breakfast
and a heavy supper. This custom ought to be
reversed. When people sup late, their supper
should be very light; but the breakfast ought always
to be solid. If any one eats a light supper,
goes soon to bed, and rises betimes in the morning,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>he will be sure to find an appetite for his
breakfast, and he may freely indulge it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The strong and healthy do not indeed suffer so
much from fasting as the weak and delicate; but
they run great hazard from its opposite, <i>viz.</i> repletion.
Many diseases, especially fevers, are the
effect of a plethora, or too great fulness of the vessels.
Strong people, in high health, have generally
a great quantity of blood and other humours.
When these are suddenly increased, by an overcharge
of rich and nourishing diet, the vessels become
too much distended, and obstructions and
inflammations ensue. Hence so many people are
seized with inflammatory and eruptive fevers after
a feast or debauch.</p>

<p class='c008'>All great and sudden changes in diet are dangerous.
What the stomach has been long accustomed
to digest, though less wholesome, will
agree better with it than food of a more salutary
nature which it has not been used to. When therefore
a change becomes necessary, it ought always
to be made gradually; a sudden transition from a
poor and low, to a rich and luxurious diet, or the
contrary, might so disturb the functions of the body
as to endanger health, or even to occasion death
itself.</p>

<p class='c008'>When we recommend regularity in diet, we would
not be understood as condemning every small deviation
from it. It is next to impossible for people
at all times to avoid some degree of excess, and
living too much by rule might make even the
smallest deviation dangerous. It may therefore be
prudent to vary a little, sometimes taking more,
sometimes less, than the usual quantity of meat and
drink, provided always that a due regard be had to
moderation.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. IV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF AIR.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Unwholesome air is a very common cause
of diseases. Few are aware of the danger
arising from it. People generally pay some attention
to what they eat and drink, but seldom regard
what goes into the lungs, though the latter proves
often more suddenly fatal than the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>Air, as well as water, takes up parts of most
bodies with which it comes in contact, and is often
so replenished with those of a noxious quality, as
to occasion immediate death. But such violent
effects seldom happen, as people are generally on
their guard against them. The less perceptible influences
of bad air prove more generally hurtful to
mankind; we shall therefore endeavour to point
out some of these, and to shew from whence the
danger chiefly arises.</p>

<p class='c008'>Air may become noxious many ways. Whatever
greatly alters its degree of heat, cold, moisture,
&#38;c. renders it unwholesome: for example, that
which is too hot dissipates the watry parts of the
blood, exalts the bile, and renders the whole humour
adust and thick. Hence proceed bilious and
inflammatory fevers, cholera morbus, &#38;c. Very
cold air obstructs the perspiration, constringes the
solids, and condenses the fluids. It occasions rheumatisms,
coughs, and catarrhs, with other diseases
of the throat and breast. Air that is too moist destroys
the elasticity or spring of the solids, induces
phlegmatic or lax constitutions, and disposes the
body to agues, or intermitting fevers, dropsies, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever great numbers of people are crowded
into one place, if the air has not a free circulation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>it soon becomes unwholesome. Hence it is that
delicate persons are so apt to turn sick or faint in
crowded churches, assemblies, or any place where
the air is injured by breathing, fires, candles, or
the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>In great cities so many things tend to contaminate
the air, that it is no wonder it proves so fatal
to the inhabitants. The air in cities is not only
breathed repeatedly over, but is likewise loaded
with sulphur, smoke, and other exhalations, besides
the vapours continually arising from innumerable
putrid substances, as dunghills, slaughterhouses,
&#38;c. All possible care should be taken to
keep the streets of large towns open and wide, that
the air may have a free current through them.
They ought likewise to be kept very clean. Nothing
tends more to pollute and contaminate the
air of a city than dirty streets.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very common in this country to have
church-yards in the middle of populous cities.
Whether this be the effect of ancient superstition,
or owing to the increase of such towns, is a matter
of no consequence. Whatever gave rise to the
custom, it is a bad one. It is habit alone which
reconciles us to these things; by means of which
the most ridiculous, nay pernicious customs, often
become sacred. Certain it is, that thousands of
putrid carcasses, so near the surface of the earth, in
a place where the air is confined, cannot fail to
taint it; and that such air, when breathed into the
lungs, must occasion diseases<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c010'><sup>[28]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Burying within churches is a practice still more
detestable. The air in churches is seldom good,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>and the effluvia from putrid carcasses must render it
still worse. Churches are commonly old buildings
with arched roofs. They are seldom open above
once a week, are never ventilated by fires nor open
windows, and rarely kept clean. This occasions
that damp, musty, unwholesome smell which one
feels upon entering a church, and renders it a very
unsafe place for the weak and valetudinary. These
inconveniences might, in a great measure, be obviated,
by prohibiting all persons from burying
within churches, by keeping them clean, and permitting
a stream of fresh air to pass frequently through
them, by opening opposite doors and windows<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c010'><sup>[29]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever air stagnates long, it becomes unwholesome.
Hence the unhappy persons confined
in jails not only contract malignant fevers themselves,
but often communicate them to others.
Nor are many of the holes, for we cannot call them
houses, possessed by the poor in great towns, much
better than jails. These low dirty habitations are
the very lurking-places of bad air and contagious
diseases. Such as live in them seldom enjoy good
health; and their children commonly die young.
In the choice of a house, those who have it in their
power ought always to pay the greatest attention to
open free air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various methods which luxury has invented
to make houses close and warm, contribute not a
little to render them unwholesome. No house can
be wholesome unless the air has a free passage
through it. For which reason houses ought daily
to be ventilated, by opening opposite windows, and
admitting a current of fresh air into every room.
Beds, instead of being made up as soon as people
rise out of them, ought to be turned down, and
exposed to the fresh air from the open windows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>through the day. This would expel any noxious
vapour, and could not fail to promote the health
of the inhabitants.</p>

<p class='c008'>In hospitals, jails, ships, &#38;c. where that cannot
be conveniently done, ventilators should be used.
The method of expelling foul, and introducing
fresh air, by means of ventilators, is a most salutary
invention, and is indeed the most useful of
all our modern medical improvements. It is capable
of universal application, and is fraught with
numerous advantages, both to those in health and
sickness. In all places, where numbers of people
are crowded together, ventilation becomes absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Air which stagnates in mines, wells, cellars, &#38;c.
is extremely noxious. That kind of air is to be
avoided as the most deadly poison. It often kills
almost as quickly as lightning. For this reason,
people should be very cautious in opening cellars
that have been long shut, or going down into deep
wells or pits, especially if they have been kept close
covered<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c010'><sup>[30]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people who have splendid houses, chuse
to sleep in small apartments. This conduct is very
imprudent. A bed-chamber ought always to be
well-aired; as it is generally occupied in the night
only, when all doors and windows are shut. If a
fire be kept in it, the danger from a small room
becomes still greater. Numbers have been stifled
when asleep by a fire in a small apartment, which
is always hurtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are obliged, on account of business,
to spend the day in close towns, ought, if possible,
to sleep in the country. Breathing free air in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>night will, in some measure, make up for the want
of it through the day. This practice would have
a greater effect in preserving the health of citizens
than is commonly imagined.</p>

<p class='c008'>Delicate persons ought, as much as possible, to
avoid the air of great towns. It is peculiarly hurtful
to the asthmatic and consumptive. Such persons
should avoid cities as they would the plague.
The hypochondriac are likewise much hurt by it.
I have often seen persons so much afflicted with this
malady while in town, that it seemed impossible
for them to live, who, upon being removed to the
country, were immediately relieved. The same
observation holds with regard to nervous and hysteric
women. Many people, indeed, have it not
in their power to change their situation in quest of
better air. All we can say to such persons is, that
they should go as often abroad into the open air
as they can, that they should admit fresh air frequently
into their houses, and take care to keep
them very clean.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was necessary in former times, for safety, to
surround cities, colleges, and even single houses,
with high walls. These, by obstructing the free
current of air, never fail to render such places
damp and unwholesome. As such walls are now,
in most parts of this country, become useless, they
ought to be pulled down, and every method taken
to admit a free passage to the air. Proper attention
to <span class='sc'>Air</span> and <span class='sc'>Cleanliness</span> would tend more to
preserve the health of mankind, than all the endeavours
of the faculty.</p>

<p class='c008'>Surrounding houses too closely with planting, or
thick woods, likewise tends to render the air unwholesome.
Wood not only obstructs the free current
of the air, but sends forth great quantities of
moist exhalations, which render it constantly damp.
Wood is very agreeable at a proper distance from a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>house, but should never be planted too near it, especially
in a flat country. Many of the gentlemen’s
seats in England are rendered very unwholesome from
the great quantity of wood which surrounds them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Houses situated in low marshy countries, or near
large lakes of stagnating water, are likewise unwholesome.
Waters which stagnate not only render
the air damp, but load it with putrid exhalations,
which produce the most dangerous and fatal diseases.
Those who are obliged to inhabit marshy
countries, ought to make choice of the dryest situations
they can find, to live generously, and to pay
the strictest regard to cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>If fresh air be necessary for those in health, it is
still more so for the sick, who often lose their lives
for want of it. The notion that sick people must be
kept very hot, is so common, that one can hardly
enter the chamber where a patient lies, without
being ready to faint, by reason of the hot suffocating
smell. How this must affect the sick any one
may judge. No medicine is so beneficial to the sick
as fresh air. It is the most reviving of all cordials,
if it be administered with prudence. We are not,
however, to throw open doors and windows at random
upon the sick. Fresh air is to be let into the
chamber gradually, and, if possible, by opening
the windows of some other apartment.</p>

<p class='c008'>The air of a sick person’s chamber may be greatly
freshened, and the patient much revived, by sprinkling
the floor, bed, &#38;c. frequently with vinegar,
juice of lemon, or any other strong vegetable acid.</p>

<p class='c008'>In places where numbers of sick are crowded into
the same house, or, which is often the case, into the
same apartment, the frequent admission of fresh air
becomes absolutely necessary. Infirmaries, hospitals,
&#38;c. are often rendered so noxious, for want of
proper ventilation, that the sick run more hazard
from them than from the disease. This is particularly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>the case when putrid fevers, dysenteries, and
other infectious diseases prevail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Physicians, surgeons, and others who attend hospitals,
ought, for their own safety, to take care
that they be properly ventilated. Such persons as
are obliged to spend most of their time amongst the
sick, run great hazard of being themselves infected
when the air is bad. All hospitals, and places of
reception for the sick, ought to have an open situation,
at some distance from any great town, and
such patients as labour under any infectious disease
ought never to be suffered to come near the rest<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c010'><sup>[31]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. V.<br> <span class='c015'>OF EXERCISE.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Many people look upon the necessity man is
under of earning his bread by labour, as a
curse. Be this as it may, it is evident from the
structure of the body, that exercise is not less necessary
than food for the preservation of health: those
whom poverty obliges to labour for daily bread, are
not only the most healthy, but generally the most
happy part of mankind. Industry seldom fails to
place them above want, and activity serves them
instead of physic. This is peculiarly the case with
those who live by the culture of the ground. The
great increase of inhabitants in infant colonies, and
the longevity of such as follow agriculture every
where, evidently prove it to be the most healthful
as well as the most useful employment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>The love of activity shews itself very early in man.
So strong is this principle, that a healthy youth
cannot be restrained from exercise, even by the fear
of punishment. Our love of motion is surely a
strong proof of its utility. Nature implants no
disposition in vain. It seems to be a catholic law
throughout the whole animal creation, that no
creature, without exercise, should enjoy health, or
be able to find subsistence. Every creature, except
man, takes as much of it as is necessary. He alone,
and such animals as are under his direction, deviate
from this original law, and they suffer accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inactivity never fails to induce an universal relaxation
of the solids, which disposes the body to
innumerable diseases. When the solids are relaxed,
neither the digestion, nor any of the secretions, can
be duly performed. In this case, the worst consequences
must ensue. How can persons who loll
all day in easy chairs, and sleep all night on beds of
down, fail to be relaxed? Nor do such greatly mend
the matter, who never stir abroad but in a coach,
sedan, or such like. These elegant pieces of luxury
are become so common, that the inhabitants of great
towns seem to be in some danger of losing the use
of their limbs altogether. It is now below any one
to walk, who can afford to be carried. How ridiculous
would it seem, to a person unacquainted with
modern luxury, to behold the young and healthy
swinging along on the shoulders of their fellow-creatures!
or to see a fat carcase, over-run with diseases
occasioned by inactivity, dragged through the
streets by half a dozen horses<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c010'><sup>[32]</sup></a>!</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>Glandular obstructions, now so common, generally
proceed from inactivity. These are the most
obstinate of maladies. So long as the liver, kidnies,
and other glands, duly perform their functions,
health is seldom impaired; but, when they
fail, nothing can restore it. Exercise is almost the
only cure we know for glandular obstructions; indeed,
it does not always succeed as a remedy; but
there is reason to believe that it would seldom fail
to prevent these complaints, were it used in due
time. One thing is certain, that, amongst those
who take sufficient exercise, glandular diseases are
very little known; whereas the indolent and inactive
are seldom free from them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weak nerves are the constant companions of inactivity.
Nothing but exercise and open air can
brace and strengthen the nerves, or prevent the endless
train of diseases which proceed from a relaxed
state of these organs. We seldom hear the active or
laborious complain of nervous diseases; these are
reserved for the sons of ease and affluence. Many
have been completely cured of these disorders by
being reduced, from a stare of opulence, to labour
for their daily bread. This plainly points out the
sources from whence nervous diseases flow, and the
means by which they may be prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is absolutely impossible to enjoy health, where
the perspiration is not duly carried on; but that can
never be the case where exercise is neglected. When
the matter which ought to be thrown off by perspiration
is retained in the body, it vitiates the humours,
and occasions the gout, fevers, rheumatism,
&#38;c. Exercise alone would prevent many of
those diseases which cannot be cured, and would
remove others where medicine proves ineffectual.</p>

<p class='c008'>A late author<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c010'><sup>[33]</sup></a>, in his excellent treatise on health,
says, that the weak and valetudinary ought to make
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>exercise a part of their religion. We would recommend
this, not only to the weak and valetudinary,
but to all whose business does not oblige
them to take sufficient exercise, as sedentary artificers<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c010'><sup>[34]</sup></a>,
shop-keepers, studious persons, &#38;c. Such
ought to use exercise as regularly as they take
food. This might generally be done without any
interruption to business or real loss of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>No piece of indolence hurts the health more than
the modern custom of lying a-bed too long in a
morning. This is the general practice in great towns.
The inhabitants of cities seldom rise before eight or
nine o’clock; but the morning is undoubtedly the
best time for exercise, while the stomach is empty,
and the body refreshed with sleep. Besides, the
morning air braces and strengthens the nerves, and,
in some measure, answers the purpose of a cold
bath. Let any one who has been accustomed to
lie a-bed till eight or nine o’clock, rise by six or
seven, spend a couple of hours in walking, riding,
or any active diversion without doors, and he will
find his spirits cheerful and serene through the day,
his appetite keen, and his body braced and strengthened.
Custom soon renders early rising agreeable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>and nothing contributes more to the preservation
of health.</p>

<p class='c008'>The inactive are continually complaining of pains
of the stomach, flatulencies, indigestions, &#38;c. These
complaints, which pave the way to many others, are
not to be removed by medicines. They can only
be cured by a vigorous course of exercise, to which
indeed they seldom fail to yield.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise, if possible, ought always to be taken
in the open air. When that cannot be done, various
methods may be contrived for exercising the
body within doors, as the dumb bell, dancing,
fencing, &#38;c. It is not necessary to adhere strictly
to any particular kind of exercise. The best way
is to take them by turns, and to use that longest
which is most suitable to the strength and constitution.
Those kinds of exercise which give action
to most of the bodily organs, are always to be preferred,
as walking, running, riding, digging, swimming,
and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is much to be regretted, that active and manly
diversions are now so little practised. Diversions
make people take more exercise than they otherwise
would do, and are of the greatest service to
such as are not under the necessity of labouring
for their bread. As active diversions lose ground,
those of a sedentary kind seem to prevail. Sedentary
diversions are of no other use but to consume
time. Instead of relieving the mind, they often
require more thought than either study or business.
Every thing that induces people to sit still, unless
it be some necessary employment, ought to be
avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diversions which afford the best exercise
are, hunting, shooting, playing at cricket, handball,
golf<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c010'><sup>[35]</sup></a>, &#38;c. These exercise the limbs, promote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>perspiration, and the other secretions. They
likewise strengthen the lungs, and give firmness
and agility to the whole body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as can, ought to spend two or three hours
a-day on horseback; those who cannot ride, should
employ the same time in walking. Exercise should
never be continued too long. Over-fatigue prevents
the benefit of exercise, and instead of strengthening
the body tends to weaken it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every man should lay himself under some sort of
necessity to take exercise. Indolence, like other
vices when indulged, gains ground, and at length
becomes agreeable. Hence many who were fond
of exercise in the early part of life, become quite
averse from it afterwards. This is the case of most
hypochondriac and gouty people, which renders their
diseases in a great measure incurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some countries laws have been made, obliging
every man, of whatever rank, to learn some mechanical
employment. Whether such laws were
designed for the preservation of health, or the encouragement
of manufacture, is a question of no
importance, Certain it is, that if gentlemen were
frequently to amuse and exercise themselves in this
way, it might have many good effects. They would
at least derive as much honour from a few masterly
specimens of their own workmanship, as from the
character of having ruined most of their companions
by gaming or drinking. Besides, men of leisure, by
applying themselves to the mechanical arts, might
improve them, to the great benefit of society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indolence not only occasions diseases, and renders
men useless to society, but promotes all manner
of vice. To say a man is idle, is little better
than to call him vicious. The mind, if not engaged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>in some useful pursuit, is constantly in quest
of ideal pleasures, or impressed with the apprehension
of some imaginary evil. From these sources
proceed most of the miseries of mankind. Certainly
man was never intended to be idle. Inactivity frustrates
the very design of his creation; whereas an
active life is the best guardian of virtue, and the
greatest preservative of health.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. VI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF SLEEP AND CLOTHING.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Sleep, as well as diet, ought to be duly regulated.
Too little sleep weakens the nerves,
exhausts the spirits, and occasions diseases; and too
much renders the mind dull, the body gross, and
disposes to apoplexies, lethargies, and other complaints
of a similar nature. A medium ought therefore
to be observed; but this is not easy to fix.
Children require more sleep than grown persons,
the laborious than the idle, and such as eat and
drink freely, than those who live abstemiously.
Besides, the real quantity of sleep cannot be measured
by time; as one person will be more refreshed
by five or six hours sleep, than another by eight
or ten.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children may always be allowed to take as much
sleep as they please; but, for adults, six or seven
hours is certainly sufficient, and no one ought to
exceed eight. Those who lie a-bed more than eight
hours may slumber, but they can hardly be said to
sleep; such generally toss and dream away the
fore-part of the night, sink to rest towards morning,
and dose till noon. The best way to make
sleep sound and refreshing is to rise betimes. The
custom of lying a-bed for nine or ten hours, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>only makes the sleep less refreshing, but relaxes the
solids, and greatly weakens the constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nature points out night as the proper season for
sleep. Nothing more certainly destroys the constitution
than night-watching. It is great pity that
a practice so destructive to health should be so
much in fashion. How quickly the want of rest
in due season will blast the most blooming complexion,
or ruin the best constitution, is evident
from the ghastly countenances of those who, as
the phrase is, turn day into night, and night into
day.</p>

<p class='c008'>To make sleep refreshing, the following things are
requisite: First, to take sufficient exercise in the
open air; to avoid strong tea or coffee; next, to eat
a light supper; and lastly, to lie down with a mind
as cheerful and serene as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is certain that too much exercise will prevent
sleep, as well as too little. We seldom however
hear the active and laborious complain of restless
nights. It is the indolent and slothful who generally
have these complaints. Is it any wonder that
a bed of down should not be refreshing to a person
who sits all day in an easy chair? A great part of the
pleasure of life consists in alternate rest and motion;
but they who neglect the latter can never relish
the former. The labourer enjoys more true luxury
in plain food and sound sleep, than is to be found
in sumptuous tables and downy pillows, where exercise
is wanting.</p>

<p class='c008'>That light suppers cause sound sleep, is true even
to a proverb. Many persons, if they exceed the
least at that meal, are sure to have uneasy nights;
and, if they fall asleep, the load and oppression
on their stomach and spirits occasion frightful
dreams, broken and disturbed repose, the night-mare,
&#38;c. Were the same persons to go to bed
with a light supper, or sit up till that meal was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>pretty well digested, they would enjoy sound sleep,
and rise refreshed and cheerful. There are indeed
some people who cannot sleep unless they have eat
some solid food at night, but this does not imply
the necessity of a heavy supper; besides, these are
generally persons who have accustomed themselves
to this method, and who do not take a sufficient
quantity of solid food and exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing more certainly disturbs our repose than
anxiety. When the mind is not at ease, one seldom
enjoys sound sleep. The greatest of human blessings
flies the wretched, and visits the happy, the
cheerful, and the gay. This is a sufficient reason
why every man should endeavour to be as easy in his
mind as possible when he goes to rest. Many, by
indulging grief and anxious thought, have banished
sound sleep so long, that they could never afterwards
enjoy it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sleep, when taken in the fore-part of the night,
is generally reckoned most refreshing. Whether
this be the effect of habit or not, is hard to say; but
as most people are accustomed to go early to bed
when young, it may be presumed that sleep, at this
season, will prove most refreshing to them ever after.
Whether the fore-part of the night be best for sleep
or not, surely the fore-part of the day is fitted both
for business and amusement. I hardly ever knew
an early riser who did not enjoy a good state of
health<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c010'><sup>[36]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Clothing.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The clothing ought to be suited to the climate.
Custom has no doubt a very great influence in this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>article; but no custom can ever change the nature
of things so far, as to render the same clothing fit for
an inhabitant of Nova Zembla and the island of Jamaica.
It is not indeed necessary to observe an exact
proportion between the quantity of clothes we wear,
and the degree of latitude which we inhabit; but,
at the same time, proper attention ought to be paid
to it, as well as to the openness of the country, the
frequency and violence of storms, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>In youth, while the blood is hot and the perspiration
free, it is less necessary to cover the body with
a great quantity of clothes; but, in the decline of
life, when the skin becomes rigid and the humours
more cool, the clothing should be increased. Many
diseases in the latter period of life proceed from a
defect of perspiration: these may, in some measure,
be prevented by a suitable addition to the clothing,
or by wearing such as are better calculated for promoting
the discharge from the skin, as clothes made
of cotton, flannel, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The clothing ought likewise to be suited to the
season of the year. Clothing may be warm enough
for summer, which is by no means sufficient for
winter. The greatest caution, however, is necessary
in making these changes. We ought neither to
put off our winter clothes too soon, nor to wear our
summer ones too long. In this country, the winter
often sets in very early with great rigour, and we have
frequently cold weather even after the commencement
of the summer months. It would likewise
be prudent not to make the change all at once, but
to do it gradually; and indeed the changes of apparel
in this climate ought to be very inconsiderable,
especially among those who have passed the meridian
of life<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c010'><sup>[37]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>Clothes often become hurtful by their being
made subservient to the purposes of pride or vanity.
Mankind in all ages seem to have considered
clothes in this view; accordingly their fashion and
figure have been continually varying, with very
little regard either to health, the climate, or conveniency:
a farthingale, for example, may be very
necessary in hot southern climates, but surely nothing
can be more ridiculous in the cold regions of
the north.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even the human shape is often attempted to be
mended by dress, and those who know no better
believe that mankind would be monsters without
its assistance. All attempts of this nature are
highly pernicious. The most destructive of them
in this country is that of squeezing the stomach
and bowels into as narrow a compass as possible, to
procure, what is falsely called, a fine shape<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c010'><sup>[38]</sup></a>. By
this practice the action of the stomach and bowels,
the motion of the heart and lungs, and almost all
the vital functions, are obstructed. Hence proceed
indigestions, syncopes, or fainting fits, coughs,
consumptions of the lungs, and other complaints
so common among females.</p>

<p class='c008'>The feet likewise often suffer by pressure. How
a small foot came to be reckoned genteel, I will
not pretend to say; but certain it is, that this notion
has made many persons lame. Almost nine-tenths
of mankind are troubled with corns: a disease
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>that is seldom or never occasioned but by strait
shoes. Corns are not only very troublesome, but
by rendering people unable to walk, they may
likewise be considered as the remote cause of other
diseases<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c010'><sup>[39]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The size and figure of the shoe ought certainly
to be adapted to the foot. In children the feet are
as well shaped as the hands, and the motion of the
toes as free and easy as that of the fingers; yet
few persons in the advanced periods of life are able
to make any use of their toes. They are generally,
by narrow shoes, squeezed all of a heap, and often
laid over one another in such a manner as to be rendered
altogether incapable of motion. Nor is the
high heel less hurtful than the narrow toe. A lady
may seem taller for walking on her tiptoes, but she
will never walk well in this manner. It strains her
joints, distorts her limbs, makes her stoop, and utterly
destroys all her ease and gracefulness of motion:
it is entirely owing to shoes with high heels and
narrow toes, that not one female in ten can be said
to walk well.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fixing on the clothes, due care should be taken
to avoid all tight bandages. Garters, buckles, &#38;c.
when drawn too tight, not only prevent the free
motion and use of the parts about which they are
bound, but likewise obstruct the circulation of the
blood, which prevents the equal nourishment and
growth of these parts, and occasions various diseases.
Tight bandages about the neck, as stocks,
cravats, necklaces, &#38;c. are extremely dangerous.
They obstruct the blood in its course from the
brain, by which means head-achs, vertigoes, apoplexies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and other fatal diseases are often occasioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>The perfection of dress is to be easy and clean.
Nothing can be more ridiculous, than for any one
to make himself a slave to fine clothes. Such a one,
and many such there are, would rather remain as
fixt as a statue from morning till night, than discompose
a single hair or alter the position of a pin.
Were we to recommend any particular pattern for
dress, it would be that which is worn by the people
called Quakers. They are always neat, clean, and
often elegant, without any thing superfluous. What
others lay out upon tawdry laces, ruffles, and ribands,
they bestow upon superior cleanliness. Finery is only
the affectation of dress, and very often covers a great
deal of dirt.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall only add, with regard to clothing, that
it ought not only to be suited to the climate, the
season of the year, and the period of life; but likewise
to the temperature and constitution. Robust
persons are able to endure either cold or heat better
than the delicate; consequently may be less attentive
to their clothing. But the precise quantity of
clothes necessary for any person cannot be determined
by reasoning. It is entirely a matter of experience,
and every man is the best judge for himself
what quantity of clothes is necessary to keep
him warm<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c010'><sup>[40]</sup></a>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. VII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF INTEMPERANCE.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A modern author<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c010'><sup>[41]</sup></a> observes, that temperance
and exercise are the two best physicians
in the world. He might have added, that
if these were duly regarded, there would be little
occasion for any other. Temperance may justly
be called the parent of health; yet numbers of
mankind act as if they thought diseases and death
too slow in their progress, and by intemperance
and debauch seem as it were to solicit their approach.</p>

<p class='c008'>The danger of intemperance appears from the
very construction of the human body. Health
depends on that state of the solids and fluids
which fits them for the due performance of the
vital functions; and, while these go regularly on,
we are sound and well; but whatever disturbs
them necessarily impairs health. Intemperance
never fails to disorder the whole animal œconomy;
it hurts the digestion, relaxes the nerves, renders
the different secretions irregular, vitiates the humours,
and occasions numberless diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The analogy between the nourishment of plants
and animals affords a striking proof of the danger of
intemperance. Moisture and manure greatly promote
vegetation; yet an over-quantity of either will
entirely destroy it. The best things become hurtful,
nay destructive, when carried to excess. Hence
we learn, that the highest degree of human wisdom
consists in regulating our appetites and passions so as
to avoid all extremes. It is that chiefly which entitles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>us to the character of rational beings. The
slave of appetite will ever be the disgrace of human
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Author of Nature hath endued us with various
passions, for the propagation of the species, the
preservation of the individual, &#38;c. Intemperance is
the abuse of these passions; and moderation consists
in the proper regulation of them. Men, not contented
with satisfying the simple calls of Nature,
create artificial wants, and are perpetually in search
of something that may gratify them; but imaginary
wants can never be gratified. Nature is content
with little; but luxury knows no bounds. Hence
the epicure, the drunkard, and the debauchee, seldom
stop in their career, till their money or their constitution
fails: then indeed they generally see their
error when too late.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to lay down fixt rules with regard
to diet, on account of the different constitutions
of mankind. The most ignorant person, however,
certainly knows what is meant by excess; and
it is in the power of every man, if he chuses, to
avoid it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great rule of diet is to study simplicity. Nature
delights in the most plain and simple food, and
every animal, except man, follows her dictates. Man
alone riots at large, and ransacks the whole creation
in quest of luxuries, to his own destruction. An elegant
writer<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c010'><sup>[42]</sup></a> of the last age speaks thus of intemperance
in diet: “For my part, when I behold a
fashionable table set out in all its magnificence,
I fancy that I see gouts and dropsies, fevers and
lethargies, with other innumerable distempers,
lying in ambuscade among the dishes.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is intemperance in other things less destructive
than in diet. How quickly does the immoderate
pursuit of carnal pleasures, or the abuse of intoxicating
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>liquors, ruin the best constitution! Indeed
these vices generally go hand in hand. Hence it is
that we so often behold the votaries of Bacchus and
Venus, even before they have arrived at the prime
of life, worn out with diseases, and hasting with swift
pace to an untimely grave. Did men reflect on the
painful diseases, and premature deaths, which are
daily occasioned by intemperance, it would be sufficient
to make them shrink back with horror from
the indulgence even of their darling pleasures.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intemperance does not hurt its votaries alone;
the innocent too often feel the direful effects of it.
How many wretched orphans are to be seen embracing
dunghills, whose parents, regardless of the future,
spent in riot and debauch what might have
served to bring up their offspring in a decent manner?
How often do we behold the miserable mother,
with her helpless infants, pining in want, while the
cruel father is indulging his insatiate appetites?</p>

<p class='c008'>Families are not only reduced to misery, but even
extirpated, by intemperance. Nothing tends so
much to prevent propagation, and to shorten the
lives of children, as the intemperance of parents.
The poor man who labours all day, and at night
lies down contented with his humble fare, can boast
a numerous offspring, while his pampered lord,
sunk in ease and luxury, often languishes without
an heir to his ample fortunes. Even states and empires
feel the influence of intemperance, and rise
or fall as it prevails.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of mentioning the different kinds of intemperance,
and pointing out their influence upon
health, we shall only, by way of example, make a
few observations on one particular species of that
vice, <i>viz.</i> the abuse of intoxicating liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every act of intoxication puts Nature to the expence
of a fever, in order to discharge the poisonous
draught. When this is repeated almost every day, it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>is easy to foresee the consequences. That constitution
must be strong indeed, which is able long to
hold out under a daily fever! but fevers occasioned
by drinking do not always go off in a day; they frequently
end in an inflammation of the breast, liver,
or brain, and produce fatal effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the drunkard should not fall by an acute
disease, he seldom escapes those of a chronic kind.
Intoxicating liquors, when used to excess, weaken
the bowels and spoil the digestion; they destroy the
power of the nerves, and occasion paralytic and convulsive
disorders; they likewise heat and inflame the
blood, destroy its balsamic quality, render it unfit
for circulation, and the nourishment of the body.
Hence obstructions, atrophies, dropsies, and consumptions
of the lungs. These are the common ways
in which drunkards make their exit. Diseases of
this kind, when brought on by hard drinking, seldom
admit of a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people injure their health by drinking, who
seldom get drunk. The continual habit of soaking,
as it is called, though its effects be not so violent, is
not less pernicious. When the vessels are kept constantly
full and upon the stretch, the different digestions
can neither be duly performed, nor the humours
properly prepared. Hence most people of
this character are afflicted with the gout, the gravel,
ulcerous sores in the legs, &#38;c. If these disorders do
not appear, they are seized with low spirits, hypochondriacal
affections, and other symptoms of indigestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consumptions are now so common, that it is
thought one-tenth of the inhabitants of great towns
die of that disease. Hard drinking is no doubt one
of the causes to which we must impute the increase
of consumptions. The great quantities of viscid
malt liquor drank by the common people of England,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>cannot fail to render the blood sizy and unfit
for circulation; from whence proceed obstructions,
and inflammations of the lungs. There are few great
ale-drinkers who are not phthisical: nor is that to be
wondered at, considering the glutinous and almost
indigestible nature of strong ale.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who drink ardent spirits or strong wines run
still greater hazard; these liquors heat and inflame
the blood, and tear the tender vessels of the lungs to
pieces; yet so great is the consumption of them in
this country, that one would almost be induced to
think that the inhabitants lived upon them<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c010'><sup>[43]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The habit of drinking proceeds frequently from
misfortunes in life. The miserable fly to it for relief.
It affords them indeed a temporary ease. But,
alas! this solace is short-lived; and when it is over,
the spirits sink as much below their usual tone as
they had before been raised above it. Hence a repetition
of the dose becomes necessary, and every
fresh dose makes way for another, till the unhappy
wretch becomes a slave to the bottle, and at length
falls a sacrifice to what at first perhaps was taken
only as a medicine. No man is so dejected as the
drunkard when his debauch is gone off. Hence it
is, that those who have the greatest flow of spirits
while the glass circulates freely, are of all others the
most melancholy when sober, and often put an end
to their own miserable existence in a fit of spleen or
ill humour.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>Drunkenness not only proves destructive to health,
but likewise to the faculties of the mind. It is
strange that creatures who value themselves on account
of a superior degree of reason to that of brutes,
should take pleasure in sinking so far below them.
Were such as voluntarily deprive themselves of the
use of reason, to continue ever after in that condition,
it would seem but a just punishment. Though this
be not the consequence of one act of intoxication,
it seldom fails to succeed a course of it. By a habit
of drinking, the greatest genius is often reduced to
a mere idiot<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c010'><sup>[44]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intoxication is peculiarly hurtful to young persons.
It heats their blood, impairs their strength,
and obstructs their growth; besides, the frequent
use of strong liquors in the early part of life destroys
any benefit that might arise from them afterwards.
Those who make a practice of drinking generous
liquors when young, cannot expert to reap any
benefit from them as a cordial in the decline of
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Drunkenness is not only in itself a most abominable
vice, but is an inducement to many others.
There is hardly any crime so horrid that the drunkard
will not perpetrate for the love of liquor. We
have known mothers sell their children’s clothes, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>food that they should have eat, and afterwards even
the infants themselves, in order to purchase the accursed
draught.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. VIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF CLEANLINESS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The want of cleanliness is a fault which admits
of no excuse. Where water can be had for
nothing, it is surely in the power of every person to
be clean. The continual discharge from our bodies
by perspiration, renders frequent change of apparel
necessary. Changing apparel greatly promotes the
secretion from the skin, so necessary for health.
When that matter which ought to be carried off by
perspiration, is either retained in the body, or resorbed
from dirty clothes, it must occasion diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Diseases of the skin are chiefly owing to want of
cleanliness<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c010'><sup>[45]</sup></a>. They may indeed be caught by infection,
or brought on by poor living, unwholesome
food, &#38;c. but they will seldom continue long where
cleanliness prevails. To the same cause must we impute
the various kinds of vermin which infest the
human body, houses, &#38;c. These may always be
banished by cleanliness alone, and wherever they
abound, we have reason to believe it is neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>One common cause of putrid and malignant fevers,
is the want of cleanliness. These fevers commonly
begin among the inhabitants of close dirty houses,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>who breathe unwholesome air, take little exercise,
and wear dirty clothes. There the infection is generally
hatched, which often spreads far and wide, to
the destruction of many. Hence cleanliness may be
considered as an object of public attention. It is
not sufficient that I be clean myself, while the want
of it in my neighbour affects my health as well as his
own. If dirty people cannot be removed as a common
nuisance, they ought at least to be avoided as
infectious. All who regard their health should keep
at a distance even from their habitations.</p>

<p class='c008'>In places where great numbers of people are collected,
cleanliness becomes of the utmost importance.
It is well known that infectious diseases are
communicated by tainted air. Every thing, therefore,
which tends to pollute the air, or spread the
infection, ought with the utmost care to be guarded
against. For this reason, in great towns, no filth, of
any kind, should be permitted to lie upon the streets.
Nothing is more apt to convey infection than the
excrements of the diseased.</p>

<p class='c008'>In many great towns the streets are little better
than dunghills, being frequently covered with ashes,
dung, and nastiness of every kind. Even slaughterhouses,
or killing shambles, are often to be seen in
the very centre of great towns. The putrid blood,
excrements, &#38;c. with which these places are generally
covered, cannot fail to taint the air, and render
it unwholesome. How easily might this be
prevented by active magistrates, who have it always
in their power to make proper laws relative to
things of this nature, and to enforce the observance
of them!</p>

<p class='c008'>We are sorry to say, that the importance of general
cleanliness does not seem to be sufficiently understood
by the magistrates of most great towns in
Britain; though health, pleasure, and delicacy, all
conspire to recommend an attention to it. Nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>can be more agreeable to the senses, more to the
honour of the inhabitants, or more conducive to
their health, than a clean town; nor can any thing
impress a stranger with a more disrespectful idea of
any people than its opposite. Whatever pretensions
people may make to learning, politeness, or civilization,
we will venture to affirm, that while they
neglect cleanliness, they are in a state of barbarity<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c010'><sup>[46]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The peasants in most countries seem to hold cleanliness
in a sort of contempt. Were it not for the open
situation of their houses, they would often feel the
bad effects of this disposition. One seldom sees a
farm-house without a dunghill before the door, and
frequently the cattle and their masters lodge under
the same roof. Peasants are likewise extremely careless
with respect to change of apparel, keeping their
houses, &#38;c. clean. This is merely the effect of indolence
and a dirty disposition. Habit may indeed
render it less disagreeable to them, but no habit can
ever make it salutary to wear dirty clothes or breathe
unwholesome air.</p>

<p class='c008'>As many articles of diet come through the hands
of peasants, every method should be taken to encourage
and promote habits of cleanliness among them.
This, for example, might be done by giving a small
premium to the person who brings the cleanest and
best article of any kind to market, as butter, cheese,
&#38;c. and by punishing severely those who bring it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>dirty. The same method should be taken with
butchers, bakers, brewers, and all who are employed
in preparing the necessaries of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>In camps the strictest regard should be paid to
cleanliness. By negligence in this matter, infectious
diseases are often spread amongst a whole army; and
frequently more die of these than by the sword. The
Jews during their encampments in the wilderness,
received particular instructions with respect to cleanliness<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c010'><sup>[47]</sup></a>.
The rules enjoined them ought to be observed
by all in the like situation. Indeed the whole
system of laws delivered to that people has a manifest
tendency to promote cleanliness. Whoever considers
the nature of their climate, the diseases to
which they were liable, and their dirty disposition,
will see the propriety of such laws.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is remarkable that, in most eastern countries,
cleanliness makes a great part of their religion.
The Mahometan, as well as the Jewish religion,
enjoins various bathings, washings, and purifications.
No doubt these might be designed to represent inward
purity; but they were at the same time calculated
for the preservation of health. However
whimsical these washings may appear to some, few
things would tend more to prevent diseases than a
proper attention to many of them. Were every
person, for example, after visiting the sick, handling
a dead body, or touching any thing that might
convey infection, to wash before he went into company,
or sat down to meat, he would run less hazard
either of catching the infection himself, or of communicating
it to others.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frequent washing not only removes the filth and
sordes which adhere to the skin, but likewise promotes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the perspiration, braces the body, and enlivens
the spirits. How refreshed, how cheerful, and agreeable
does one feel on being shaved, washed, and shifted;
especially when these offices have been neglected
longer than usual!</p>

<p class='c008'>The eastern custom of washing the feet, though
less necessary in this country, is nevertheless a very
agreeable piece of cleanliness, and contributes greatly
to the preservation of health. The sweat and dirt
with which these parts are frequently covered, cannot
fail to obstruct the perspiration. This piece of
cleanliness would often prevent colds and fevers.
Were people careful to bathe their feet and legs in
lukewarm water at night, after being exposed to cold
or wet through the day, they would seldom experience
the ill effects which often proceed from these
causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proper attention to cleanliness is no where more
necessary than on shipboard. If epidemical distempers
break out there, no one can be safe. The best
way to prevent them, is to take care that the whole
company be cleanly in their clothes, bedding, &#38;c.
When infectious diseases do break out, cleanliness
is the most likely means to prevent their spreading;
it is likewise necessary to prevent their returning
afterwards, or being conveyed to other places. For
this purpose, the clothes, bedding, &#38;c. of the sick
ought to be carefully washed, and fumigated with
brimstone. Infection will lodge a long time in dirty
clothes, and afterwards break out in the most terrible
manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>In places where great numbers of sick people are
collected together, cleanliness ought to be most religiously
observed. The very smell in such places
is often sufficient to make one sick. It is easy to
imagine what effect that is likely to have upon the
diseased. In an hospital or infirmary, where cleanliness
is neglected, a person in perfect health has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>greater chance to become sick, than a sick person
has to get well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things are more unaccountable than that
neglect, or rather dread of cleanliness, which appears
among those who have the care of the sick; they
think it almost criminal to suffer any thing that is
clean to come near a person in a fever, for example,
and would rather allow him to wallow in all manner
of filth, than change the least bit of his linen. If
cleanliness be necessary for persons in health, it is
certainly more so for the sick. Many diseases may
be cured by cleanliness alone; most of them might
be mitigated by it; and, where it is neglected, the
slightest disorders are often changed into the most
malignant. The same mistaken care which prompted
people to prevent the least admission of fresh air to
the sick, seems to have induced them to keep them
dirty. Both these destructive prejudices will, we
hope, be soon entirely eradicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cleanliness is certainly agreeable to our nature.
We cannot help approving it in others, even though
we should not practice it ourselves. It sooner attracts
our regard than even finery itself, and often gains
esteem where that fails. It is an ornament to the
highest as well as the lowest station, and cannot be
dispensed with in either. Few virtues are of more
importance to society than general cleanliness. It
ought to be carefully cultivated every where; but in
populous cities it should be almost revered<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c010'><sup>[48]</sup></a>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. IX.<br> <span class='c015'>OF INFECTION.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Many diseases are infectious. Every person
ought therefore, as far as he can, to avoid all
communication with the diseased. The common
practice of visiting the sick, though often well meant,
has many ill consequences. Far be it from us to
discourage any act of charity or benevolence, especially
towards those in distress; but we cannot help
blaming such as endanger their own or their neighbours
lives by a mistaken friendship or an impertinent
curiosity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The houses of the sick, especially in the country,
are generally crowded from morning till night with
idle visitors. It is customary, in such places, for
servants and young people to wait upon the sick by
turns, and even to sit up with them all night. It
would be a miracle indeed should such always escape.
Experience teaches us the danger of this conduct.
People often catch fevers in this way, and communicate
them to others, till at length they become
epidemic.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be thought highly improper, for one
who had not had the small-pox, to wait upon a patient
in that disease; yet many other fevers are almost
as infectious as the small-pox, and not less fatal.
Some imagine that fevers prove more fatal in
villages than in great towns, for want of proper
medical assistance. This may sometimes be the
case; but we are inclined to think it oftener proceeds
from the cause above mentioned.</p>

<p class='c008'>Were a plan to be laid down for communicating
infection, it could not be done more effectually
than by the common method of visiting the sick.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Such visitors not only endanger themselves and their
connections, but likewise hurt the sick. By crowding
the house, they render the air unwholesome, and
by their private whispers and dismal countenances
disturb the imagination of the patient, and depress
his spirits. Persons who are ill, especially in fevers,
ought to be kept as quiet as possible. The sight of
strange faces, and every thing that disturbs the mind,
hurts them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common practice in country-places of inviting
great numbers of people to funerals, and
crowding them into the same apartment where the
corpse lies, is another way of spreading infection.
The infection does not always die with the patient.
Every thing that comes into contact with his body
while alive, receives the contagion, and some of
them, as clothes, blankets, &#38;c. will retain it for a
long time. Persons who die of infectious disorders
ought not to lie long unburied; and people
should keep as much as possible at a distance from
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would tend greatly to prevent the spreading of
infectious diseases, if those in health were kept at
a proper distance from the sick. The Jewish Legislator,
among many other wise institutions for
preserving health, has been peculiarly attentive to
the means of preventing infection, or <i>defilement</i> as it
is called, either from a diseased person or a dead body.
In many cases the diseased were to be separated from
those in health; and it was deemed a crime even
to approach their habitations. If a person only
touched a diseased or dead body, he was appointed
to wash himself in water, and to keep for some time
at a distance from society.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infectious diseases are often communicated by
clothes. It is extremely dangerous to wear apparel
which has been worn by the deceased, unless it has
been well washed and fumigated, as infection may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>lodge a long time in it, and afterwards produce very
tragical effects. This shews the danger of buying
at random the clothes which have been worn by
other people.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infectious disorders are frequently imported.
Commerce, together with the riches of foreign
climes, brings us also their diseases. These do
often more than counterbalance all the advantages
of that trade by means of which they are introduced.
It is to be regretted, that so little care is
commonly bestowed, either to prevent the introduction
or spreading of infectious maladies. Some
attention indeed is generally paid to the plague;
but other diseases pass unregarded<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c010'><sup>[49]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infection is often spread through cities, by jails,
hospitals, &#38;c. These are frequently situated in the
very middle of populous towns; and when infectious
diseases break out in them, it is impossible
for the inhabitants to escape. Did magistrates pay
any regard to the health of the people, this evil
might be easily remedied.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many are the causes which tend to diffuse infection
through populous cities. The whole atmosphere
of a large town is one contaminated mass,
abounding with various kinds of infection, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>must be pernicious to health. The best advice that
we can give to such as are obliged to live in large
cities is, to chuse an open situation; to avoid narrow,
dirty, crowded streets; to keep their own house and
offices clean; and to be as much abroad in the open
air as their time will permit.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would tend greatly to prevent the spreading of
infectious diseases, were proper nurses every where
employed to take care of the sick. This might
often save a family, or even a whole town, from
being infected by one person. We do not mean
that people should abandon their friends or relations
in distress, but only to put them on their
guard against being too much in company with
those who are afflicted with diseases of an infectious
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as wait upon the sick in infectious diseases run
very great hazard. They should stuff their noses
with tobacco, or some other strong smelling herb,
as rue, tansy, or the like. They ought likewise
to keep the patient very clean, to sprinkle the room
where he lies with vinegar, or other strong acids,
frequently to admit a stream of fresh air into it, and
to avoid the smell of his breath as much as they can.
They ought never to go into company without
having changed their clothes and washed their
hands; otherwise, if the disease be infectious, they
will in all probability carry the contagion along
with them<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c010'><sup>[50]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>However trifling it may appear to inconsiderate
persons, we will venture to affirm, that a due attention
to those things which tend to diffuse infection
would be of great importance in preventing diseases.
As most diseases are in some degree infectious,
no one should continue long with the sick, except
the necessary attendants. I mean not, however, by
this caution, to deter those whose duty or office leads
them to wait upon the sick, from such a laudable
and necessary employment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many things are in the power of the magistrate
which would tend to prevent the spreading of infection;
as the promoting of public cleanliness; removing
jails, hospitals, burying grounds, and other
places where infection may be generated, at a proper
distance from great towns<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c010'><sup>[51]</sup></a>; widening the
streets; pulling down useless walls, and taking all
methods to promote a free circulation of air through
every part of the town, &#38;c. Public hospitals, or
proper places of reception for the sick, provided
they were kept clean, well ventilated, and placed
in an open situation, would likewise tend to prevent
the spreading of infection. Such places of
reception would prevent the poor, when sick, from
being visited by their idle or officious neighbours.
They would likewise render it unnecessary for sick
servants to be kept in their master’s houses. Masters
had better pay for having their servants taken care
of in an hospital, than run the hazard of having an
infectious disease diffused among a numerous family.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Sick servants and poor people, when placed
in hospitals, are not only less apt to diffuse infection
among their neighbours, but have likewise the advantage
of being well attended.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are not, however, to learn that hospitals, instead
of preventing infection, may become the means
of diffusing it. When they are placed in the middle
of great towns; when numbers of patients are
crowded together in small apartments; when there
is a constant communication kept up between the
citizens and the patients; and when cleanliness
and ventilation are neglected, they become nests
for hatching diseases, and every one who goes into
them not only runs a risk of receiving infection
himself, but likewise of communicating it to others.
This however is not the fault of the hospitals, but
of those who have the management of them. It
were to be wished, that they were both more numerous,
and upon a more respectable footing, as
that would induce people to go into them with
less reluctance. This is the more to be desired,
because most of the putrid fevers and other infectious
disorders break out among the poor, and are
by them communicated to the better sort. Were
proper attention paid to the first appearances of
such disorders, and the patients early conveyed to
an hospital, we should seldom see a putrid fever,
which is almost as infectious as the plague, become
epidemic.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. X.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE PASSIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The passions have great influence both in the
cause and cure of diseases. How the mind affects
the body, will in all probability ever remain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>a secret. It is sufficient for us to know, that there
is established a reciprocal influence between the mental
and corporeal parts; and that whatever injures
the one disorders the other.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Anger.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The passion of <i>anger</i> ruffles the mind, distorts the
countenance, hurries on the circulation of the blood,
and disorders the whole vital and animal functions.
It often occasions fevers, and other acute diseases;
and sometimes even sudden death. This passion is
peculiarly hurtful to the delicate, and those of weak
nerves. I have known such persons frequently lose
their lives by a violent fit of anger, and would advise
them to guard against the excess of this passion
with the utmost care.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not indeed always in our power to prevent
being angry; but we may surely avoid harbouring
resentment in our breast. Resentment preys upon
the mind, and occasions the most obstinate chronical
disorders, which gradually waste the constitution.
Nothing shews true greatness of mind more than to
forgive injuries; it promotes the peace of society,
and greatly conduces to our own ease, health, and
felicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as value health should avoid violent gusts
of anger, as they would the most deadly poison.
Neither ought they to indulge resentment, but to
endeavour at all times to keep their minds calm and
serene. Nothing tends so much to the health of the
body as a constant tranquillity of mind.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Fear.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The influence of <i>fear</i>, both in occasioning and
aggravating diseases, is very great. No man
ought to be blamed for a decent concern about
life; but too great a desire to preserve it is often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>the cause of losing it. Fear and anxiety, by depressing
the spirits, not only dispose us to diseases,
but often render those diseases fatal which an undaunted
mind would overcome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sudden fear has generally violent effects. Epileptic
fits, and other convulsive disorders, are often
occasioned by it. Hence the danger of that practice,
so common among young people, of frightening
one another. Many have lost their lives, and
others have been rendered miserable, by frolics of
this kind. It is dangerous to tamper with the
human passions. The mind may easily be thrown
into such disorder as never again to act with regularity.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the gradual effects of fear prove most hurtful.
The constant dread of some future evil, by
dwelling upon the mind, often occasions the very
evil itself. Hence it comes to pass, that so many
die of those very diseases of which they long had
a dread, or which had been impressed on their
minds by some accident, or foolish prediction.
This, for example, is often the case with women
in child-bed. Many of those who die in that situation
are impressed with the notion of their death a
long time before it happens; and there is reason
to believe that this impression is often the cause
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The methods taken to impress the minds of
women with the apprehensions of the great <i>pain</i> and
<i>peril</i> of child-birth, are very hurtful. Few women
die in labour, though many lose their lives after it;
which may be thus accounted for. A woman after
delivery, finding herself weak and exhausted, immediately
apprehends she is in danger; but this
fear seldom fails to obstruct the necessary evacuations,
upon which her recovery depends. Thus
the sex often fall a sacrifice to their own imaginations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>when there would be no danger, did they
apprehend none.</p>

<p class='c008'>It seldom happens that two or three women in a
great town die in child-bed, but their death is followed
by many others. Every woman of their acquaintance
who is with child dreads the same fate,
and the disease becomes epidemical by the mere force
of imagination. This should induce pregnant women
to despise fear, and by all means to avoid those
tattling gossips who are continually buzzing in their
ears the misfortunes of others. Every thing that
may in the least alarm a pregnant or child-bed woman,
ought with the greatest care to be guarded
against.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many women have lost their lives in child-bed
by the old superstitious custom, still kept up in most
parts of Britain, of tolling the parish bell for every
person who dies. People who think themselves in
danger are very inquisitive; and if they come to
know that the bell tolls for one who died in the same
situation with themselves, what must be the consequence?
At any rate they are apt to suppose that this
is the case, and it will often be found a very difficult
matter to persuade them of the contrary.</p>

<p class='c008'>But this custom is not pernicious to child-bed
women only. It is hurtful in many other cases.
When low fevers, in which it is difficult to support
the patient’s spirits, prevail, what must be the effect
of a funeral peal sounding five or six times a day
in his ears? No doubt his imagination will suggest
that others died of the same disease under which
he labours. This apprehension will have a greater
tendency to depress his spirits, than all the cordials
of which medicine can boast will have to raise
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this useless piece of ceremony cannot be abolished,
we ought to keep the sick as much from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>hearing it as possible, and from every other thing that
may tend to alarm them. So far however is this
from being generally attended to, that many make
it their business to visit the sick, on purpose to whisper
dismal stories in their ears. Such may pass for
sympathizing friends, but they ought rather to be
considered as enemies. All who wish well to the sick
ought to keep such persons at the greatest distance
from them.</p>

<p class='c008'>A custom has long prevailed among physicians,
of prognosticating, as they call it, the patient’s
fate, or foretelling the issue of the disease. Vanity
no doubt introduced this practice, and still supports
it, in spite of common sense and the safety of mankind.
I have known a physician barbarous enough
to boast, that he pronounced more <i>sentences</i> than all
his Majesty’s judges. Would to God that such sentences
were not often equally fatal! It may indeed
be alleged, that the doctor does not declare his
opinion before the patient. So much the worse.
A sensible patient had better hear what the doctor
says, than learn it from the disconsolate looks, the
watery eyes, and the broken whispers of those about
him. It seldom happens, when the doctor gives
an unfavourable opinion, that it can be concealed
from the patient. The very embarrassment which
the friends and attendants shew in disguising what
he has said, is generally sufficient to discover the
truth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Kind Heaven has, for the wisest ends, concealed
from mortals their fate; and we do not see what
right any man has to announce the death of another,
especially if such a declaration has a chance
to kill him. Mankind are indeed very fond of
prying into future events, and seldom fail to solicit
the physician for his opinion. A doubtful answer,
however, or one that may tend rather to
encourage the hopes of the sick, is surely the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>safe. This conduct could neither hurt the patient
nor the physician. Nothing tends more to destroy
the credit of physic than those bold prognosticators,
who, by the bye, are generally the
most ignorant of the faculty. The mistakes which
daily happen in this way are so many standing
proofs of human vanity, and the weakness of
science.</p>

<p class='c008'>We readily admit, that there are cases where the
physician ought to give intimation of the patient’s
danger to some of his near connexions; though even
this ought always to be done with the greatest caution:
but it never can be necessary in any case
that the whole town and country should know,
immediately after the doctor has made his first visit,
<i>that he has no hopes of his patient’s recovery</i>. Persons
whose impertinent curiosity leads them to question
the physician, with regard to the fate of his patient,
certainly deserve no other than an evasive
answer.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vanity of foretelling the fate of the sick is
not peculiar to the faculty. Others follow their
example, and those who think themselves wiser
than their neighbours often do much hurt in this
way. Humanity surely calls upon every one to
comfort the sick, and not to add to their affliction
by alarming their fears. A friend, or even a physician,
may often do more good by a mild and sympathizing
behaviour than by medicine, and should
never neglect to administer that greatest of all cordials,
<span class='sc'>Hope</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Grief.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Grief is the most destructive of all the passions.
Its effects are permanent, and when it sinks deep
into the mind, it generally proves fatal. Anger
and fear, being of a more violent nature, seldom
last long; but grief often changes into a fixed melancholy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>which preys upon the spirits, and wastes the
constitution. This passion ought not to be indulged.
It may generally be conquered at the beginning; but
when it has gained strength, all attempts to remove
it are vain.</p>

<p class='c008'>No person can prevent misfortunes in life; but
it shews true greatness of mind to bear them with
serenity. Many persons make a merit of indulging
grief, and when misfortunes happen, they obstinately
refuse all consolation, till the mind, overwhelmed
with melancholy, sinks under the load.
Such conduct is not only destructive to health, but
inconsistent with reason, religion, and common
sense.</p>

<p class='c008'>Change of ideas is as necessary for health as
change of posture. When the mind dwells long
upon one subject, especially of a disagreeable nature,
it hurts the whole functions of the body.
Hence grief indulged spoils the digestion and
destroys the appetite; by which means the spirits
are depressed, the nerves relaxed, the bowels inflated
with wind, and the humours, for want of
fresh supplies of chyle, vitiated. Thus many an
excellent constitution has been ruined by a family
misfortune, or any thing that occasions excessive
grief.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is utterly impossible, that any person of a dejected
mind should enjoy health. Life may indeed
be dragged out for a few years; but whoever
would live to a good old age, must be good-humoured
and cheerful. This indeed is not altogether
in our own power; yet our temper of mind,
as well as our actions, depend greatly upon ourselves.
We can either associate with cheerful or
melancholy companions, mingle in the amusements
and offices of life, or sit still and brood over our calamities
as we choose. These, and many such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>things, are certainly in our power, and from these
the mind generally takes its cast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The variety of scenes which present themselves
to the senses, were certainly designed to prevent
our attention from being too long fixed upon any
one object. Nature abounds with variety, and the
mind, unless fixed down by habit, delights in contemplating
new objects. This at once points out
the method of relieving the mind in distress. Turn
the attention frequently to new objects. Examine
them for some time. When the mind begins to
recoil, shift the scene. By this means a constant
succession of new ideas may be kept up, till the
disagreeable ones entirely disappear. Thus travelling,
the study of any art or science, reading or
writing on such subjects as deeply engage the attention,
will sooner expel grief than the most sprightly
amusements.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed, that the body cannot
be healthy unless it be exercised; neither can
the mind. Indolence nourishes grief. When the
mind has nothing else to think of but calamities,
no wonder that it dwells there. Few people who
pursue business with attention are hurt by grief. Instead
therefore of abstracting ourselves from the world
or business, when misfortunes happen, we ought to
engage in it with more than usual attention, to discharge
with double diligence the functions of our
station, and to mix with friends of a cheerful and
social temper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Innocent amusements are by no means to be neglected.
These, by leading the mind insensibly to
the contemplation of agreeable objects, help to
dispel the gloom which misfortunes cast over it.
They make time seem less tedious, and have many
other happy effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some persons, when overwhelmed with grief, betake
themselves to drinking. This is making the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>cure worse than the disease. It seldom fails to end
in the ruin of fortune, character, and constitution.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Love.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Love is perhaps the strongest of all the passions;
at least, when it becomes violent, it is less subject
to the control either of the understanding or will,
than any of the rest. Fear, anger, and several other
passions, are necessary for the preservation of the individual,
but love is necessary for the continuation
of the species itself; it was therefore proper that
this passion should be deeply rooted in the human
breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though love be a strong passion, it is seldom so
rapid in its progress as several of the others. Few
persons fall desperately in love all at once. We
would therefore advise every one, before he tampers
with this passion, to consider well the probability
of his being able to obtain the object of his
love. When that is not likely, he should avoid every
occasion of increasing it. He ought immediately
to fly the company of the beloved object; to apply
his mind attentively to business or study; to take
every kind of amusement; and above all, to endeavour,
if possible, to find another object which may
engage his affections, and which it may be in his
power to obtain.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no passion with which people are so
ready to tamper as love, although none is more
dangerous. Some men make love for amusement,
others from mere vanity, or on purpose to shew
their consequence with the fair. This is perhaps the
greatest piece of cruelty which any one can be
guilty of. What we eagerly wish for we easily credit.
Hence the too credulous fair are often betrayed
into a situation which is truly deplorable,
before they are able to discover that the pretended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>lover was only in jest. But there is no jesting with
this passion. When love is got to a certain height,
it admits of no other cure but the possession of its
object, which in this case ought always if possible to
be obtained<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c010'><sup>[52]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Religious Melancholy.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Many persons of a religious turn of mind behave
as if they thought it a crime to be cheerful.
They imagine the whole of religion consists in
certain mortifications, or denying themselves the
smallest indulgence, even of the most innocent
amusements. A perpetual gloom hangs over their
countenances, while the deepest melancholy preys
upon their minds. At length the fairest prospects
vanish, every thing puts on a dismal appearance,
and those very objects which ought to give delight
afford nothing but disgust. Life itself becomes a
burden, and the unhappy wretch, persuaded that
no evil can equal what he feels, often puts an end
to his own miserable existence.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is great pity that ever religion should be so
far perverted, as to become the cause of those very
evils which it was designed to cure. Nothing can
be better calculated than <i>True Religion</i>, to raise
and support the mind of its votaries under every affliction
that can befal them. It teaches them that
even the sufferings of this life are preparatory to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>the happiness of the next; and that all who persist
in a course of virtue shall at length arrive at complete
felicity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons whose business it is to recommend religion
to others, should beware of dwelling too much
on gloomy subjects. That peace and tranquillity
of mind, which true religion is calculated to inspire,
is a more powerful argument in its favour
than all the terrors that can be uttered. Terror
may indeed deter men from outward acts of wickedness,
but can never inspire them with that love of
God, and real goodness of heart, in which alone true
religion consists.</p>

<p class='c008'>To conclude; the best way to counteract the violence
of any passion, is to keep the mind closely engaged
in some useful pursuit.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE COMMON EVACUATIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The principal evacuations from the human
body are those by <i>stool</i>, <i>urine</i>, and <i>insensible
perspiration</i>. None of these can be long obstructed
without impairing the health. When that which
ought to be thrown out of the body is too long
retained, it not only occasions a <i>plethora</i>, or too great
fulness of the vessels, but acquires qualities which
are hurtful to the health, as acrimony, putrescence,
&#38;c.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of the Evacuation by Stool.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Few things conduce more to health than keeping
the body regular. When the <i>fæces</i> lie too long
in the bowels, they vitiate the humours; and when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>they are too soon discharged, the body is not sufficiently
nourished. A medium is therefore to be
desired, which can only be obtained by regularity
in diet, sleep, and exercise. Whenever the body
is not regular, there is reason to suspect a fault in
one or other of these.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who eat and drink at irregular hours,
and who eat various kinds of food, and drink of
several different liquors at every meal, have no reason
to expect either that their digestion will be good,
or their discharges regular. Irregularity in eating
and drinking disturbs every part of the animal œconomy,
and never fails to occasion diseases. Either
too much or too little food will have this effect.
The former indeed generally occasions looseness, and
the latter costiveness; but both have a tendency to
hurt the health.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be difficult to ascertain the exact number
of stools which may be consistent with health,
as these differ in the different periods of life, in different
constitutions, and even in the same constitution
under a different regimen of diet, exercise, &#38;c. It
is however generally allowed, that one stool a-day
is sufficient for an adult, and that less is hurtful.
But this, like most general rules, admits of many
exceptions. I have known persons in perfect health
who did not go to stool above once a-week. Such
a degree of costiveness however is not safe; though
the person who labours under it may for some time
enjoy tolerable health, yet at length it may occasion
diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>One method of procuring a stool every day is to
rise betimes, and go abroad in the open air. Not
only the posture in bed is unfavourable to regular
stools, but also the warmth. This, by promoting
the perspiration, lessens all the other discharges.</p>

<p class='c008'>The method recommended for this purpose by
Mr. Locke is likewise very proper, <i>viz. to solicit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>nature, by going regularly to stool every morning
whether one has a call or not</i>. Habits of this kind
may be acquired, which will in time become natural.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who have frequent recourse to medicines
for preventing costiveness seldom fail to ruin their
constitution. Purging medicines frequently repeated
weaken the bowels, hurt the digestion, and
every dose makes way for another, till at length
they become as necessary as daily bread. Those who
are troubled with costiveness ought rather, if possible,
to remove it by diet than drugs. They should likewise
go thinly clothed, and avoid every thing of an
astringent or of an heating nature. The diet and
other regimen necessary in this case will be found
under the article <i>Costiveness</i>, where this state of the
bowels is treated as a disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such persons as are troubled with a habitual looseness
ought likewise to suit their diet to the nature
of their complaint. They should use food which
braces and strengthens the bowels, and which is
rather of an astringent quality, as wheat-bread made
of the finest flour, cheese, eggs, rice boiled in milk,
&#38;c. Their drink should be red port, claret, brandy
and water in which toasted bread has been boiled,
and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a habitual looseness is often owing to an obstructed
perspiration, persons affected with it ought
to keep their feet warm, to wear flannel next their
skin, and take every other method to promote the
perspiration. Further directions with regard to the
treatment of this complaint will be found under the
article <i>Looseness</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of Urine.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>So many things tend to change both the quantity
and appearances of the urine, that it is very difficult
to lay down any determined rules for judging of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>either<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c010'><sup>[53]</sup></a>. Dr. Cheyne says, the urine ought to be
equal to three-fourths of the liquid part of our aliment.
But suppose any one were to take the trouble
of measuring both, he would find that every thing
which altered the degree of perspiration, would alter
this proportion, and likewise that different kinds of
aliment would afford very different quantities of
urine. Though for these, and other reasons, no rule
can be given for judging of the precise quantity of
urine which ought to be discharged, yet a person of
common sense will seldom be at a loss to know when
it is in either extreme.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a free discharge of urine not only prevents but
actually cures many diseases, it ought by all means
to be promoted; and every thing that may obstruct
it should be carefully avoided. Both the secretion
and discharge of urine are lessened by a sedentary
life, sleeping on beds that are too soft and warm,
food of a dry and heating quality, liquors which are
astringent and heating, as red port, claret, and such
like. Those who have reason to suspect that their
urine is in too small quantity, or who have any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>symptoms of the gravel, ought not only to avoid
these things, but whatever else they find has a tendency
to lessen the quantity of their urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the urine is too long retained, it is not only
resorbed, or taken up again into the mass of fluids,
but by stagnating in the bladder it becomes thicker,
the more watery parts flying off first, and the more
gross and earthy remaining behind. By the constant
tendency which these have to concrete, the formation
of stones and gravel in the bladder is promoted.
Hence it comes to pass, that indolent and sedentary
people are much more liable to these diseases, than
persons of a more active life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many persons have lost their lives, and others
have brought on very tedious, and even incurable
disorders, by retaining their urine too long, from a
false delicacy. When the bladder has been over-distended,
it often loses its power of action altogether,
or becomes paralytic, by which means it is rendered
unable either to retain the urine, or expel it properly.
The calls of Nature ought never to be postponed.
Delicacy is doubtless a virtue, but that can never be
reckoned true delicacy, which induces any one to
risk his health or hazard his life.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the urine may be in too great as well as too
small a quantity. This may be occasioned by drinking
large quantities of weak watery liquors, by the
excessive use of alkaline salts, or any thing that stimulates
the kidnies, dilutes the blood, &#38;c. This disorder
very soon weakens the body, and induces a
consumption. It is difficult to cure, but may be
mitigated by strengthening diet and astringent medicines,
such as are recommended under the article
Diabetes, or excessive discharge of urine.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of the Perspiration.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Insensible perspiration is generally reckoned the
greatest of all the discharges from the human body.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>It is of so great importance to health, that few diseases
attack us while it goes properly on; but when
it is obstructed, the whole frame is soon disordered.
This discharge however, being less perceptible than
any of the rest, is consequently less attended to.
Hence it is, that acute fevers, rheumatisms, agues,
&#38;c. often proceed from obstructed perspiration before
we are aware of its having taken place.</p>

<p class='c008'>On examining patients, we find most of them impute
their diseases either to violent colds which they
had caught, or to slight ones which had been neglected.
For this reason, instead of a critical inquiry
into the nature of the perspiration, its difference
in different seasons, climates, constitutions, &#38;c.
we shall endeavour to point out the causes which
most commonly obstruct it, and to shew how far they
may be either avoided, or have their influence counteracted
by timely care. The want of a due attention
to these, costs Britain annually some thousands
of useful lives.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Changes in the Atmosphere.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>One of the most common causes of obstructed perspiration,
or catching cold, in this country, is the
changeableness of the weather, or state of the atmosphere.
There is no place where such changes happen
more frequently than in Great Britain. With
us the degrees of heat and cold are not only very
different in the different seasons of the year, but often
change almost from one extreme to another in a
few days, and sometimes even in the course of one
day. That such changes must affect the state of the
perspiration is obvious to every one<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c010'><sup>[54]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>The best method of fortifying the body against
the changes of the weather, is to be abroad every
day. Those who keep most within doors are most
liable to catch cold. Such persons generally render
themselves so delicate as to feel even the slightest
changes in the atmosphere, and by their pains, coughs,
and oppressions of the breast, &#38;c. they become a kind
of living barometers.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Wet Clothes.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Wet clothes not only by their coldness obstruct
the perspiration, but their moisture, by being absorbed,
or taken up into the body, greatly increases
the danger. The most robust constitution is not
proof against the danger arising from wet clothes;
they daily occasion fevers, rheumatisms, and other
fatal disorders, even in the young and healthy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible for people who go frequently
abroad to avoid sometimes being wet. But the
danger might generally be lessened, if not wholly
prevented, by changing their clothes soon; when
this cannot be done, they should keep in motion till
they be dry. So far are many from taking this precaution,
that they often sit or lie down in the fields
with their clothes wet, and frequently sleep even
whole nights in this condition. The frequent instances
which we have of the fatal effects of this conduct,
ought certainly to deter others from being
guilty of it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Wet Feet.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Even wet feet often occasion fatal diseases. The
colic, inflammations of the breast and of the bowels,
the iliac passion, <i>cholera morbus</i>, &#38;c. are often occasioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>by wet feet. Habit will, no doubt, render
this less dangerous; but it ought, as far as possible,
to be avoided. The delicate, and those who are
not accustomed to have their clothes or feet wet
should be peculiarly careful in this respect.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Night Air.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The perspiration is often obstructed by night air;
even in summer, this ought to be avoided. The
dews which fall plentifully after the hottest day, make
the night more dangerous than when the weather
is cool. Hence, in warm countries, the evening
dews are more hurtful than where the climate is
more temperate.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very agreeable after a warm day to be
abroad in the cool evening; but this is a pleasure to
be avoided by all who value their health. The effects
of evening dews are gradual indeed, and almost
imperceptible; but they are not the less to be dreaded:
we would therefore advise travellers, labourers,
and all who are much heated by day, carefully to
avoid them. When the perspiration has been great,
these become dangerous in proportion. By not attending
to this, in flat marshy countries, where the
exhalations and dews are copious, labourers are often
seized with intermitting fevers, quinseys, and other
dangerous diseases.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Damp Beds.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Beds become damp, either from their not being
used, standing in damp houses, or in rooms without
fire. Nothing is more to be dreaded by travellers
than damp beds, which are very common in all
places where fuel is scarce. When a traveller, cold
and wet, arrives at an inn, he may by means of a
good fire, warm diluting liquor, and a dry bed,
have the perspiration restored; but if he be put into
a cold room, and laid on a damp bed, it will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>more obstructed, and the worst consequences will
ensue. Travellers should avoid inns which are
noted for damp beds, as they would a house infected
with the plague, as no man, however robust, is proof
against the danger arising from them.</p>

<p class='c008'>But inns are not the only places where damp beds
are to be met with. Beds kept in private families
for the reception of strangers are often equally dangerous.
All kinds of linen and bedding, when not
frequently used, become damp. How then is it possible
that beds, which are not slept in above two or
three times a year, should be safe? Nothing is more
common than to hear people complain of having
caught cold by changing their bed. The reason is
obvious: were they careful never to sleep in a bed
but what was frequently used, they would seldom
find any ill consequences from a change.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing is more to be dreaded by a delicate person
when on a visit, than being laid in a bed which
is kept on purpose for strangers. That ill-judged
piece of complaisance becomes a real injury. All
the bad consequences from this quarter might easily
be prevented in private families, by causing their
servants to sleep in the spare beds, and resign them
to strangers when they come. In inns where the
beds are used almost every night, nothing else is
necessary than to keep the rooms well seasoned by
frequent fires, and the linen dry.</p>

<p class='c008'>That baneful custom said to be practised in many
inns, of damping sheets, and pressing them in order
to save washing, and afterwards laying them on the
beds, ought, when discovered; to be punished with
the utmost severity. It is really a species of murder,
and will often prove as fatal as poison or gunshot.
Indeed no linen, especially if it has been
washed in winter, ought to be used till it has been
exposed for some time to the fire; nor is this operation
less necessary for linen washed in summer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>provided it has lain by for any length of time.
This caution is the more needful, as gentlemen are
often exceedingly attentive to what they eat or drink
at an inn, yet pay no regard to a circumstance of
much more importance<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c010'><sup>[55]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Damp Houses.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>Damp houses frequently produce the like ill consequences;
for this reason those who build should
be careful to chuse a dry situation. A house which
stands on a damp marshy soil or deep clay, will never
be thoroughly dry. All houses, unless where
the ground is exceeding dry, should have the first
door a little raised. Servants and others, who are
obliged to live in cellars and sunk stories, seldom
continue long in health: masters ought surely to pay
some regard to the health of their servants, as well
as to their own.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing is more common than for people, merely
to avoid some trifling inconveniency, to hazard their
lives, by inhabiting a house almost as soon as the
masons, plasterers, &#38;c. have done with it: such
houses are not only dangerous from their dampness,
but likewise from the smell of lime, paint, &#38;c.
The asthmas, consumptions, and other diseases of
the lungs, so incident to people who work in these
articles, are sufficient proofs of their being unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>Rooms are often rendered damp by an unseasonable
piece of cleanliness; I mean the pernicious
custom of washing them immediately before company
is put into them. Most people catch cold, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>they sit but a very short time in a room that has
been lately washed; the delicate ought carefully to
avoid such a situation, and even the robust are not
always proof against its influence<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c010'><sup>[56]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Sudden Transitions from Heat to Cold.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The perspiration is commonly obstructed by <span class='fss'>SUDDEN
TRANSITIONS</span> from heat to cold. Colds are
seldom caught, unless when people have been too
much heated. Heat rarifies the blood, quickens
the circulation, and increases the perspiration; but
when these are suddenly checked, the consequences
must be bad. It is indeed impossible for labourers
not to be too hot upon some occasions; but it is generally
in their power to let themselves cool gradually,
to put on their clothes when they leave off work,
to make choice of a dry place to rest themselves in,
and to avoid sleeping in the open fields. These easy
rules, if observed, would often prevent fevers and
other fatal disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very common for people, when hot, to drink
freely of cold water, or small liquors. This conduct
is extremely dangerous. Thirst indeed is hard
to bear, and the inclination to gratify that appetite
frequently gets the better of reason, and makes
us do what our judgment disapproves. Every peasant,
however, knows, if his horse be permitted to
drink his bellyful of cold water after violent exercise,
and be immediately put into the stable, or
suffered to remain at rest, that it will kill him.
This they take the utmost care to prevent. It were
well if they were equally attentive to their own
safety.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>Thirst may be quenched many ways without swallowing
large quantities of cold liquor. The fields
afford variety of acid fruits and plants, the very
chewing of which would abate thirst. Water kept in
the mouth for some time, and spit out again, if frequently
repeated, will have the same effect. If a
bit of bread be eaten along with a few mouthfuls of
water, it will both quench thirst more effectually,
and make the danger less. When a person is extremely
hot, a mouthful of brandy, or other spirits,
if it can be obtained, ought to be preferred to any
thing else. But if any one has been so foolish, when
hot, as to drink freely of cold liquor, he ought to
continue his exercise at least till what he drank be
thoroughly warmed upon his stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be tedious to enumerate all the bad effects
which flow from drinking cold liquors when
the body is hot. Sometimes this has occasioned
immediate death. Hoarseness, quinseys, and fevers
of various kinds, are its common consequences.
Neither is it safe when warm to eat freely of raw
fruits, sallads, or the like. These indeed have not
so sudden an effect on the body as cold liquors, but
they are notwithstanding dangerous, and ought to
be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sitting in a warm room, and drinking hot liquors
till the pores are quite open, and immediately going
into the cold air, is extremely dangerous. Colds,
coughs, and inflammations of the breast, are the
usual effects of this conduct: yet nothing is more
common than for people, after they have drank
warm liquors for several hours, to walk or ride a
number of miles in the coldest night, or to ramble
about in the streets<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c010'><sup>[57]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>People are very apt, when a room is hot, to throw
open a window, and to sit near it. This is a most
dangerous practice. Any person had better sit without
doors than in such a situation, as the current of
air is directed against one particular part of the body.
Inflammatory fevers and consumptions have often
been occasioned by sitting or standing thinly clothed
near an open window. Nor is sleeping with open
windows less to be dreaded. That ought never to
be done, even in the hottest season, unless the
window is at a distance. I have known mechanics
frequently contract fatal diseases, by working stript
at an open window, and would advise all of them
to beware of such a practice.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things expose people more to catch cold than
keeping their own houses too warm; such persons
may be said to live in a sort of hot-houses; they can
hardly stir abroad to visit a neighbour, but at the
hazard of their lives. Were there no other reason
for keeping houses moderately cool, that alone is
sufficient: but no house that is too hot can be wholesome;
heat destroys the spring and elasticity of the
air, and renders it less fit for expanding the lungs,
and the other purposes of respiration. Hence it is,
that consumptions and other diseases of the lungs
prove so fatal to people who work in forges, glasshouses,
and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some are even so fool-hardy, as to plunge themselves
when hot in cold water. Not only fevers, but
madness itself, has frequently been the effect of this
conduct. Indeed it looks too like the action of a
madman to deserve a serious consideration.</p>

<p class='c008'>The result of all these observations is, that every
one ought to avoid, with the utmost attention, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>sudden transitions from heat to cold, and to keep
the body in as uniform a temperature as possible;
or, where that cannot be done, to take care to let
it cool gradually.</p>

<p class='c008'>People may imagine that too strict an attention
to these things would tend to render them delicate.
So far however is this from being my design, that the
very first rule proposed for preventing colds, is to
harden the body, by enuring it daily to the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'>I shall put an end to what relates to this part of
my subject, by giving an abstract of the justly celebrated
advice of Celsus, with respect to the preservation
of health. “A man,” says he, “who is
blessed with good health, should confine himself
to no particular rules, either with respect to regimen
or medicine. He ought frequently to diversify
his manner of living; to be sometimes in
town, sometimes in the country; to hunt, sail,
indulge himself in rest, but more frequently to
use exercise. He ought to refuse no kind of food
that is commonly used, but sometimes to eat more
and sometimes less; sometimes to make one
at an entertainment, and sometimes to forbear it;
to make rather two meals a-day than one, and
always to eat heartily, provided he can digest it.
He ought neither too eagerly to pursue, nor too
scrupulously to avoid, intercourse with the fair
sex: pleasures of this kind, rarely indulged, render
the body alert and active; but, when too frequently
repeated, weak and languid. He should
be careful in time of health not to destroy, by
excesses of any kind, that vigour of constitution
which should support him under sickness.”</p>

  <h2 class='c006'>PART II.<br> <span class='c015'>OF DISEASES.</span></h2>
</div>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE KNOWLEDGE AND CURE OF DISEASES.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The knowledge of diseases does not depend
so much upon scientific principles as many
imagine. It is chiefly the result of experience and
observation. By attending the sick, and carefully
observing the various occurrences in diseases, a great
degree of accuracy may be acquired, both in distinguishing
their symptoms, and in the application
of medicines. Hence sensible nurses, and other
persons who wait upon the sick, often discover a
disease sooner than those who have been bred to
physic. We do not however mean to insinuate that
a medical education is of no use: it is doubtless of
the greatest importance; but it never can supply
the place of observation and experience.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every disease may be considered as an assemblage
of symptoms, and must be distinguished by
those which are most obvious and permanent. Instead
therefore of giving a classical arrangement
of diseases, according to the systematic method, it
will be more suitable, in a performance of this
nature, to give a full and accurate description of
each particular disease as it occurs; and, where
any of the symptoms of one disease have a near
resemblance to those of another, to take notice of
that circumstance, and at the same time to point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>out the peculiar or characteristic symptoms by which
it may be distinguished. By a due attention to these,
the investigation of diseases will be found to be a less
difficult matter than most people would at first be
ready to imagine.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proper attention to the patient’s age, sex, temper
of mind, constitution, and manner of life, will
likewise greatly assist, both in the investigation and
treatment of diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>In childhood the fibres are lax and soft, the nerves
extremely irritable, and the fluids thin; whereas
in old age the fibres are rigid, the nerves become
almost insensible, and many of the vessels imperviable.
These and other peculiarities render the
diseases of the young and aged very different, and
of course they must require a different method of
treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>Females are liable to many diseases which do not
afflict the other sex: besides, the nervous system being
more irritable in them than in men, their diseases
require to be treated with greater caution. They
are less able to bear large evacuations; and all stimulating
medicines ought to be administered to them
with a sparing hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>Particular constitutions not only dispose persons
to peculiar diseases, but likewise render it necessary
to treat these diseases in a peculiar manner. A delicate
person, for example, with weak nerves, who
lives mostly within doors, must not be treated, under
any disease, precisely in the same manner as one who
is hardy and robust, and who is much exposed to
the open air.</p>

<p class='c008'>The temper of mind ought to be carefully attended
to in diseases. Fear, anxiety, and a fretful
temper, both occasion and aggravate diseases. In
vain do we apply medicines to the body to remove
maladies which proceed from the mind.
When it is affected, the best medicine is to sooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>the passions, to divert the mind from anxious thought,
and to keep the patient as easy and cheerful as
possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Attention ought likewise to be paid to the climate,
or place where the patient lives, the air he
breathes, his diet, &#38;c. Such as live in low marshy
situations are subject to many diseases which are
unknown to the inhabitants of high countries.
Those who breathe the impure air of cities, have
many maladies to which the more happy rustics are
entire strangers. Persons who feed grossly, and
indulge in strong liquors, are liable to diseases
which do not affect the temperate and abstemious,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed, that the different
occupations and situations in life dispose men to
peculiar diseases. It is therefore necessary to inquire
into the patient’s occupation, manner of life,
&#38;c. This will not only assist us in finding out the
disease, but will likewise direct us in the treatment
of it. It would be very imprudent to treat the laborious
and the sedentary precisely in the same manner,
even supposing them to labour under the same
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will likewise be proper to inquire, whether
the disease be constitutional or accidental; whether
it has been of long or short duration; whether it
proceeds from any great and sudden alteration in
the diet, manner of life, &#38;c. The state of the
patient’s body, and of the other evacuations, ought
also to be inquired into; and likewise whether he
can with ease perform all the vital and animal functions,
as breathing, digestion, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lastly, it will be proper to inquire what diseases
the patient has formerly been liable to, and what
medicines were most beneficial to him; if he has a
strong aversion to any particular drug, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>As many of the indications of cure may be answered
by diet alone, it is always the first thing to
be attended to in the treatment of diseases. Those
who know no better, imagine that every thing which
goes by the name of a medicine possesses some
wonderful power or secret charm, and think, if the
patient swallows enough of drugs, that he must do
well. This mistake has many ill consequences; it
makes people trust to drugs, and neglect their own
endeavours; besides, it discourages all attempts
to relieve the sick where medicines cannot be
obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicines are no doubt useful in their place;
and, when administered with prudence, they may
do much good; but when they are put in place of
every thing else, or administered at random, which
is not seldom the case, they must do mischief.
We would therefore wish to call the attention of
mankind from the pursuit of secret medicines, to
such things as they are acquainted with. The proper
regulation of these may often do much good, and
there is little danger of their ever doing hurt.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every disease weakens the digestive powers. The
diet ought therefore, in all diseases, to be light and
of easy digestion. It would be as prudent for a person
with a broken leg to attempt to walk, as for one
in a fever to eat the same kind of food, and in the
same quantity, as when he was in perfect health.
Even abstinence alone will often cure a fever, especially
when it has been occasioned by excess in eating
or drinking.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all fevers attended with inflammation, as pleurisies,
peripneumonies, &#38;c. thin gruels, wheys,
watery infusions of mucilaginous plants, roots, &#38;c.
are not only proper for the patients food, but they
are likewise the best medicines which can be administered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>In fevers of a slow, nervous, or putrid kind, where
there are no symptoms of inflammation, and where
the patient must be supported with cordials, that intention
can always be more effectually answered by
nourishing diet and generous wines, than by any medicines
yet known.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is a proper attention to diet of less importance
in chronic than in acute diseases. Persons afflicted
with low spirits, wind, weak nerves, and
other hypochondriacal affections, generally find
more benefit from the use of solid food and generous
liquors, than from all the cordial and carminitive
medicines which can be administered to
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scurvy, that most obstinate malady, will sooner
yield to a proper vegetable diet, than to all the boasted
antiscorbutic remedies of the shops.</p>

<p class='c008'>In consumptions, when the humours are vitiated,
and the stomach so much weakened as to be unable
to digest the solid fibres of animals, or even to assimilate
the juices of vegetables, a diet consisting chiefly
of <i>milk</i> will not only support the patient, but will
often cure the disease after every other medicine has
failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is an attention to other things of less importance
than to diet. The strange infatuation which
has long induced people to shut up the sick from all
communication with the external air, has done great
mischief. Not only in fevers, but in many other
diseases, the patient will receive more benefit
from having the fresh air prudently admitted into
his chamber, than from all the medicines which can
be given him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise may likewise in many cases be considered
as a medicine. Sailing, or riding on horseback,
for example, will be of more service in the
cure of consumptions, glandular obstructions, &#38;c.
than any medicine yet known. In diseases which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>proceed from a relaxed state of the solids, the cold
bath, and other parts of the gymnastic regimen, will
be found equally beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things are of greater importance in the cure
of diseases than cleanliness. When a patient is suffered
to lie in dirty clothes, whatever perspires from
his body is again resorbed, or taken up into it, which
serves to nourish the disease and increase the danger.
Many diseases may be cured by cleanliness alone;
most of them may be mitigated by it, and in all of
them it is highly necessary both for the patient and
those who attend him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many other observations, were it necessary, might
be adduced to prove the importance of a proper regimen
in diseases. Regimen will often cure diseases
without medicine, but medicine will seldom succeed
where a proper regimen is neglected. For this reason,
in the treatment of diseases, we have always
given the first place to regimen. Those who are
ignorant of medicine may confine themselves to it
only. For others who have more knowledge, we
have recommended some of the most simple but approved
forms of medicine in every disease. These
however are never to be administered but by people
of better understanding; nor even by them without
the greatest precaution.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF FEVERS IN GENERAL.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As more than one half of mankind is said to
perish by fevers, it is of importance to be acquainted
with their causes. The most general
causes of fevers are, <i>infection, errors in diet, unwholesome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>air, violent emotions of the mind, excess or
suppression of usual evacuations, external or internal
injuries, and extreme degrees of heat or cold</i>. As
most of these have already been treated of at considerable
length, and their effects shewn, we shall
not now resume the consideration of them, but shall
only recommend it to all, as they would wish to avoid
fevers and other fatal diseases, to pay the most punctual
attention to these articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fevers are not only the most frequent of all diseases,
but they are likewise the most complex. In
the most simple species of fever there is always a
combination of several different symptoms. The
distinguishing symptoms of fever are, <i>increased heat</i>,
<i>frequency of pulse</i>, <i>loss of appetite</i>, <i>general debility</i>,
<i>pain in the head</i>, and <i>a difficulty in performing some
of the vital or animal functions</i>. The other symptoms
usually attendant on fevers are, nausea, thirst,
anxiety, delirium, weariness, wasting of the flesh,
want of sleep, or the sleep disturbed and not refreshing.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the fever comes on gradually, the patient
generally complains first of languor or listlessness,
soreness of the flesh, or the bones, as the country
people express it, heaviness of the head, loss of appetite,
sickness, with clamminess of the mouth; after
some time come on excessive heat, violent thirst,
restlessness, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the fever attacks suddenly, it always begins
with an uneasy sensation of excessive cold, accompanied
with debility and loss of appetite; frequently
the cold is attended with shivering, oppression
about the heart, and sickness at stomach, or
vomiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fevers are divided into continual, remitting, intermitting,
and such as are attended with cutaneous
eruption or topical inflammation, as the small-pox,
erysipelas, &#38;c. By a continual fever is meant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>that which never leaves the patient during the whole
course of the disease, or which shews no remarkable
increase or abatement in the symptoms. This kind
of fever is likewise divided into acute, slow, and
malignant. The fever is called <i>acute</i> when its progress
is quick, and the symptoms violent; but when
these are more gentle, it is generally denominated
<i>slow</i>. When livid or petechial spots shew a putrid
state of the humours, the fever is called <i>malignant</i>,
<i>putrid</i>, or <i>petechial</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A remitting fever differs from a continual only
in a degree. It has frequent increases and decreases,
or exacerbations and remissions, but never wholly
leaves the patient during the course of the disease.
Intermitting fevers or agues are those which, during
the time that the patient may be said to be ill,
have evident intervals or remissions of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a fever is only an effort of Nature to free herself
from an offending cause, it is the business of
those who have the care of the sick to observe with
diligence which way Nature points, and to endeavour
to assist her operations. Our bodies are so
framed, as to have a constant tendency to expel or
throw off whatever is injurious to health. This is
generally done by urine, sweat, stool, expectoration,
vomit, or some other evacuation.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is reason to believe, if the efforts of
Nature, at the beginning of a fever, were duly
attended to and promoted, it would seldom continue
long; but when her attempts are either neglected
or counteracted, it is no wonder if the
disease proves fatal. There are daily instances
of persons who, after catching cold, have all the
symptoms of a beginning fever; but by keeping
warm, drinking diluting liquors, bathing their
feet in warm water, &#38;c. the symptoms in a few
hours disappear, and the danger is prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>When fevers of a putrid kind threaten, the best
method of obviating their effects is by repeated
vomits.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our design is not to enter into a critical inquiry
into the nature and immediate causes of fevers,
but to mark their most obvious symptoms, and to
point out the proper treatment of the patient with
respect to his diet, drink, air, &#38;c. in the different
stages of the disease. In these articles the inclinations
of the patient will in a great measure direct
our conduct.</p>

<p class='c008'>Almost every person in a fever complains of great
thirst, and calls out for drink, especially of a cooling
nature. This at once points out the use of
<i>water</i>, and other cooling liquors. What is so likely
to abate the heat, attenuate the humours, remove
spasms and obstructions, promote perspiration, increase
the quantity of urine, and in short produce
every salutary effect in an ardent or inflammatory
fever, as drinking plentifully of water, thin gruel,
or any other weak liquor, of which water is the
basis? The necessity of diluting liquors is pointed
out by the dry tongue, the parched skin, and the
burning heat, as well as by the unquenchable thirst
of the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many cooling liquors, which are extremely grateful
to patients in a fever, may be prepared from
fruits, as decoctions of tamarinds, apple-tea, orange-whey,
and the like. Mucilaginous liquors might
also be prepared from marsh-mallow roots, linseed,
lime-tree buds, and other mild vegetables. These
liquors, especially when acidulated, are highly
agreeable to the patient, and should never be
denied him.</p>

<p class='c008'>At the beginning of a fever the patient generally
complains of great lassitude or weariness, and
has no inclination to move. This evidently shews
the propriety of keeping him easy, and if possible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>in bed. Lying in bed relaxes the spasms, abates
the violence of the circulation, and gives Nature
an opportunity of exerting all her force to overcome
the disease. The bed alone would often remove
a fever at the beginning; but when the patient
struggles with the disease, instead of driving
it off, he only fixes it the deeper, and renders it
more dangerous. This observation is too often
verified in travellers, who happen when on a journey
to be seized with a fever. Their anxiety to get
home induces them to travel with the fever upon
them, which conduct seldom fails to render it
fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fevers the mind as well as the body should be
kept easy. Company is seldom agreeable to the
sick. Indeed every thing that disturbs the imagination
increases the disease; for which reason every
person in a fever ought to be kept perfectly quiet,
and neither allowed to see nor hear any thing that may
in the least affect or discompose his mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the patient in a fever has the greatest inclination
for drink, yet he seldom has any appetite
for solid food; hence the impropriety of urging
him to take victuals is evident. Much solid food
in a fever is every way hurtful. It oppresses nature,
and, instead of nourishing the patient, serves only
to feed the disease. What food the patient takes
should be in small quantity, light, and of easy
digestion. It ought to be chiefly of the vegetable
kind, as panada, roasted apples, gruels, and
such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poor people, when any of their family are taken
ill, run directly to their rich neighbours for cordials,
and pour wine, spirits, &#38;c. into the patient,
who perhaps never had been accustomed to taste
such liquors when in health. If there be any degree
of fever, this conduct must increase it, and if
there be none, this is the ready way to raise one.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Stuffing the patient with sweetmeats and other delicacies
is likewise very pernicious. These are always
harder to digest than common food, and cannot
fail to hurt the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing is more desired by a patient in a fever
than fresh air. It not only removes his anxiety,
but cools the blood, revives the spirits, and proves
every way beneficial. Many patients are in a manner
stifled to death in fevers for want of fresh air;
yet such is the unaccountable infatuation of most
people, that the moment they think a person in a
fever, they imagine he should be kept in a close
chamber, into which not one particle of fresh air
must be admitted. Instead of this, there ought to be
a constant stream of fresh air into a sick person’s chamber,
so as to keep it moderately cool. Indeed its
degree of warmth ought never to be greater than is
agreeable to one in perfect health.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing spoils the air of a sick person’s chamber,
or hurts the patient more, than a number of people
breathing in it. When the blood is inflamed, or
the humours in a putrid state, air that has been
breathed repeatedly will greatly increase the disease.
Such air not only loses its spring, and becomes unfit
for the purpose of respiration, but acquires a
noxious quality, which renders it in a manner poisonous
to the sick.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fevers, when the patient’s spirits are low and
depressed, he is not only to be supported with cordials,
but every method should be taken to cheer
and comfort his mind. Many, from a mistaken
zeal, when they think a person in danger, instead
of solacing his mind with the hopes and consolations
of religion, fright him with the views of hell
and damnation. It would be unsuitable here to
dwell upon the impropriety and dangerous consequences
of this conduct; it often hurts the body,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>and there is reason to believe seldom benefits the
soul.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among common people, the very name of a
fever generally suggests the necessity of bleeding.
This notion seems to have taken its rise from most
fevers in this country having been formerly of an
inflammatory nature; but true inflammatory fevers
are now seldom to be met with. Sedentary occupations,
and a different manner of living, have so
changed the state of diseases in Britain, that there
is now hardly one fever in ten where the lancet is
necessary. In most low, nervous, and putrid fevers,
which are now so common, bleeding is really hurtful,
as it weakens the patient, sinks his spirits, &#38;c. We
would recommend this general rule, never to bleed
at the beginning of a fever, unless there be evident
signs of inflammation. Bleeding is an excellent
medicine when necessary, but should never be wantonly
performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is likewise a common notion, that sweating is
always necessary in the beginning of a fever. When
the fever proceeds from an obstructed perspiration,
this notion is not ill-founded. If the patient only
lies in bed, bathes his feet and legs in warm water,
and drinks freely of water-gruel, or any other weak
diluting liquor, he will seldom fail to perspire freely.
The warmth of the bed, and the diluting drink, will
relax the universal spasm, which generally affects
the skin at the beginning of a fever; it will open
the pores, and promote the perspiration, by means
of which the fever may often be carried off. But
instead of this, the common practice is to heap
clothes upon the patient, and to give him things of
a hot nature, as spirits, spiceries, &#38;c. which fire his
blood, increase the spasms, and render the disease
more dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all fevers a proper attention should be paid to
the patient’s longings. These are the calls of Nature,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>and often point out what may be of real use.
Patients are not indeed to be indulged in every thing
that the sickly appetite may crave; but it is generally
right to let them have a little of what they eagerly
desire, though it may not seem altogether proper.
What the patient longs for, his stomach will generally
digest; and such things have sometimes a
very happy effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a patient is recovering from a fever, great
care is necessary to prevent a relapse. Many persons,
by too soon imagining themselves well, have
lost their lives, or contracted other diseases of an
obstinate nature. As the body after a fever is weak
and delicate, it is necessary to guard against catching
cold. Moderate exercise in the open air will be of
use, but great fatigue is by all means to be avoided;
agreeable company will also have a good effect. The
diet must be light, but nourishing. It should be
taken frequently, but in small quantities. It is
dangerous at such a time to eat as much as the
stomach may crave.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XIV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF INTERMITTING FEVERS, OR AGUES.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Intermitting fevers afford the best opportunity
both of observing the nature of a fever,
and also the effects of medicine. No person can
be at a loss to distinguish an intermitting fever from
any other, and the proper medicine for it is now
almost universally known.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>The several kinds of intermitting fevers take their
names from the period in which the fit returns, as
quotidian, tertian, quartan, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——Agues are occasioned by effluvia
from putrid stagnating water. This is evident
from their abounding in rainy seasons, and being
most frequent in countries where the soil is marshy,
as in Holland, the Fens of Cambridgeshire, the
Hundreds of Essex, &#38;c. This disease may also
be occasioned by eating too much stone fruit, by
a poor watery diet, damp houses, evening dews,
lying upon the damp ground, watching, fatigue,
depressing passions, and the like. When the inhabitants
of a high country remove to a low one, they
are generally seized with intermitting fevers, and
to such the disease is most apt to prove fatal.
In a word, whatever relaxes the solids, diminishes
the perspiration, or obstructs the circulation in
the capillary or small vessels, disposes the body to
agues.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——An intermitting fever generally
begins with a pain of the head and loins, weariness
of the limbs, coldness of the extremities, stretching,
yawning, with sometimes great sickness and
vomiting; to which succeed shivering and violent
shaking. Afterwards the skin becomes moist, and
a profuse sweat breaks out, which generally terminates
the fit or paroxysm. Sometimes indeed the
disease comes on suddenly, when the person thinks
himself in perfect health; but it is more commonly
preceded by listlessness, loss of appetite, and the symptoms
mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——While the fit continues, the
patient ought to drink freely of water-gruel, orange-whey,
weak camomile-tea; or, if his spirits be low,
small wine-whey, sharpened with the juice of
lemon. All his drink should be warm, as that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>will assist in bringing on the sweat, and consequently
shorten the paroxysm<a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c010'><sup>[58]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between the paroxysms the patient must be supported
with food that is nourishing, but light and
easy of digestion, as veal or chicken-broths, sago,
gruel with a little wine, light puddings, and such
like. His drink may be small negus, acidulated
with the juice of lemons or oranges, and sometimes
a little weak punch. He may likewise drink infusions
of bitter herbs, as camomile, wormwood, or
water-trefoil, and may now and then take a glass
of small wine, in which gentian root, centaury, or
some other bitter, has been infused.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the chief intentions of cure in an ague are to
brace the solids, and promote perspiration, the patient
ought to take as much exercise between the
fits as he can bear. If he be able to go abroad,
riding on horseback, or in a carriage, will be of
great service. But if he cannot bear that kind of
exercise, he ought to take such as his strength will
permit. Nothing tends more to prolong an intermitting
fever, than indulging a lazy indolent disposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Intermitting fevers, under a proper regimen, will
often go off without medicine; and when the disease
is mild, in an open dry country, there is seldom
any danger from allowing it to take its course;
but when the patient’s strength seems to decline,
or the paroxysms are so violent that his life is in
danger, medicine ought immediately to be administered.
This however should never be done
till the disease be properly formed, that is to say,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>till the patient has had several fits of shaking and
sweating.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——The first thing to be done in
the cure of an intermitting fever, is to cleanse the
stomach and bowels. This not only renders the
application of other medicines more safe, but likewise
more efficacious. In this disease, the stomach
is generally loaded with cold viscid phlegm, and
frequently great quantities of bile are discharged
by vomit; which plainly points out the necessity
of such evacuations. Vomits are therefore to be
administered before the patient takes any other
medicine. A dose of ipecacuanha will generally
answer this purpose very well. A scruple or half
a dram of the powder will be sufficient for an adult,
and for a younger person the dose must be less in
proportion. After the vomit begins to operate,
the patient ought to drink plentifully of weak camomile-tea.
The vomit should be taken two or
three hours before the return of the fit, and may be
repeated at the distance of two or three days.
Vomits not only cleanse the stomach, but increase
the perspiration, and all the other secretions, which
render them of such importance, that they often cure
intermitting fevers without the assistance of any
other medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Purging medicines are likewise useful and often
necessary in intermitting fevers. A smart purge
has been known to cure an obstinate ague, after the
Peruvian bark and other medicines had been used
in vain. Vomits however are more suitable in this
disease, and render purging less necessary; but if
the patient be afraid to take a vomit, he ought in
this case to cleanse the bowels by a dose or two of
Glauber’s salt, jalap, or rhubarb.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding may sometimes be proper at the beginning
of an intermitting fever, when excessive heat,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>a delirium, &#38;c. give reason to suspect an inflammation;
but as the blood is seldom in an inflammatory
slate in intermitting fevers, this operation
is rarely necessary. When frequently repeated, it
tends to prolong the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>After proper evacuations the patient may safely
use the Peruvian bark, which may be taken in any
way that is most agreeable to him. No preparation
of the bark seems to answer better than the
most simple form in which it can be given, viz. in
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two ounces of the best Peruvian bark, finely
powdered, may be divided into twenty-four doses.
These may either be made into boluses as they are
used, with a little syrup of lemon, or mixed in a
glass of red wine, a cup of camomile-tea, water-gruel,
or any other drink that is more agreeable to
the patient<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c010'><sup>[59]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an ague which returns every day, one of the
above doses may be taken every two hours during
the interval of the fits. By this method the patient
will be able to take five or six doses between
each paroxysm. In a tertian or third-day ague it
will be sufficient to take a dose every third hour during
the interval, and in a quartan every fourth.
If the patient cannot take so large a dose of the
bark, he may divide each of the powders into two
parts, and take one every hour, &#38;c. For a young
person a smaller quantity of this medicine will be
sufficient, and the dose must be adapted to the age,
constitution, and violence of the symptoms<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c010'><sup>[60]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>The above quantity of bark will frequently cure
an ague; the patient, however, ought not to leave
off taking the medicine as soon as the paroxysms
are stopped, but should continue to use it till there
is reason to believe the disease is entirely overcome.
Most of the failures in the cure of this disease are
owing to patients not continuing to use the medicine
long enough. They are generally directed to take
it till the fits are stopped, then to leave it off, and
begin again at some distance of time; by which
means the disease gathers strength, and often returns
with as much violence as before. A relapse may
always be prevented by the patient’s continuing to
take small doses of the medicine for some time after
the symptoms disappear. This is both the most safe
and effectual method of cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ounce of gentian root, calamus aromaticus,
and orange-peel, of each half an ounce, with three
or four handfuls of camomile-flowers, and an handful
of coriander-seed, all bruised together in a mortar,
may be used in form of infusion or tea. About
half an handful of these ingredients may be put into
a tea-pot, and an English pint of boiling water
poured on them. A cup of this infusion drank three
or four times a day will greatly promote the cure.
Such patients as cannot drink the watery infusion,
may put two handfuls of the same ingredients into a
bottle of white wine, and take a glass of it twice or
thrice a day. If patients drink freely of the above,
or any other proper infusion of bitters, a smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>quantity of bark than is generally used, will be sufficient
to cure an ague<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c010'><sup>[61]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who cannot swallow the bark in substance,
may take it in decoction or infusion. An ounce of
bark in powder may be infused in a bottle of white
wine for four or five days, frequently shaking the
bottle, afterwards let the powder subside, and pour
off the clear liquor. A wine glass may be drank
three or four times a day, or oftener, as there is occasion.
If a decoction be more agreeable, an ounce
of the bark, and two drams of snake-root bruised,
with an equal quantity of salt of wormwood,
may be boiled in a quart of water, into an English
pint. To the strained liquor may be added an
equal quantity of red wine, and a glass of it taken
frequently.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstinate agues, the bark will be found much
more efficacious when assisted by brandy, or other
warm cordials, than taken alone. This I have had
frequently occasion to observe in a country where
intermittent fevers were endemical. The bark seldom
succeeded unless assisted by snake-root, ginger,
canella alba, or some other warm aromatic. When
the fits are very frequent and violent, in which case
the fever often approaches towards an inflammatory
nature, it will be safer to keep out the aromatics,
and to add salt of tartar in their stead. But in an
obstinate tertian or quartan, in the end of autumn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>or beginning of winter, warm and cordial medicines
are absolutely necessary<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c010'><sup>[62]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As autumnal and winter agues generally prove
much more obstinate than those which attack the
patient in spring or summer, it will be necessary to
continue the use of medicines longer in the former
than in the latter. A person who is seized with an
intermitting fever in the beginning of winter, ought
frequently, if the season proves rainy, to take a little
medicine, although the disease may seem to be
cured, to prevent a relapse, till the return of the
warm season. He ought likewise to take care not
to be much abroad in wet weather, especially in
cold easterly winds.</p>

<p class='c008'>When agues are not properly cured, they often
degenerate into obstinate chronical diseases, as the
dropsy, jaundice, &#38;c. For this reason all possible
care should be taken to have them radically cured,
before the constitution has been too much weakened.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though nothing is more rational than the method
of treating intermitting fevers, yet, by some strange
infatuation, more charms and whimsical remedies
are daily used for removing this than any other
disease. There is hardly an old woman who is not
in possession of a nostrum for stopping an ague;
and it is amazing with what readiness their pretensions
are believed. Those in distress eagerly grasp
at any thing that promises sudden relief; but the
shortest way is not always the best in the treatment
of diseases. The only method to obtain a safe and
lasting cure, is gradually to assist Nature in removing
the cause of the disorder.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Some indeed try bold, or rather fool-hardy experiments
to cure agues, as drinking great quantities
of strong liquors, jumping into a river, &#38;c. These
may sometimes have the desired effect, but must always
be attended with danger<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c010'><sup>[63]</sup></a>. When there is any
degree of inflammation, or the least tendency to it,
such experiments may prove fatal. The only patient
whom I remember to have lost in an intermittent fever,
evidently killed himself by drinking strong liquor,
which some person had persuaded him would
prove an infallible remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many dirty things are extolled for the cure of intermitting
fevers, as spiders, cobwebs, snuffings of
candles, &#38;c. Though these may sometimes succeed,
yet their very nastiness is sufficient to set them aside,
especially when cleanly medicines will answer the purpose
better. The only medicine that can be depended
upon, for thoroughly curing an intermittent fever,
is the Peruvian bark. It may always be used with
safety: and I can honestly declare, that in all my practice
I never knew it fail, when combined with the
medicines mentioned above, and duly persisted in.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where agues are endemical, even children are
often afflicted with that disease. Such patients are
very difficult to cure, as they can seldom be prevailed
upon to take the bark, or any other disagreeable medicine.
One method of rendering this medicine more
palatable, is to make it into a mixture with distilled
waters and syrup, and afterwards to give it an agreeable
sharpness with the elixir or spirit of vitriol. This
both improves the medicine, and takes off the nauseous
taste. In cases where the bark cannot be administered,
the <i>saline mixture</i> may be given with advantage
to children<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c010'><sup>[64]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Wine-whey is a very proper drink for a child in
an ague; to half an English pint of which may be
put a tea-spoonful of the spirit of hartshorn. Exercise
is likewise of considerable service; and when
the disease proves obstinate, the child ought, if possible,
to be removed to a warm dry air. The food
ought to be nourishing, and sometimes a little generous
wine should be allowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>To children, and such as cannot swallow the bark,
or when the stomach will not bear it, it may be given
by clyster. Half an ounce of the extract of bark,
dissolved in four ounces of warm water, with the
addition of half an ounce of sweet oil, and six or
eight drops of laudanum, in the form recommended
by Dr. Lind for an adult, and this to be repeated
every fourth hour, or oftener, as the occasion shall
require. For children the quantity of extract and
laudanum must be proportionally lessened. Children
have been cured of agues by making them wear a
waistcoat with powdered bark quilted between the
folds of it; by bathing them frequently in a strong
decoction of the bark, and by rubbing the spine
with strong spirits, or with a mixture of equal parts
of laudanum and the saponaceous liniment.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have been the more full upon this disease, because
it is very common, and because few patients in
an ague apply to physicians unless in extremities.
There are, however, many cases in which the disease
is very irregular, being complicated with other
diseases, or attended with symptoms which are both
very dangerous and very difficult to understand.
All these we have purposely passed over, as they would
only bewilder the generality of readers. When the
disease is very irregular, or the symptoms dangerous,
the patient ought immediately to apply to a physician,
and strictly to follow his advice.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent agues, people must endeavour to avoid
their causes. These have been already pointed out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>in the beginning of this section; we shall therefore
only add one preventive medicine, which may be of
use to such as are obliged to live in low marshy countries,
or who are liable to frequent attacks of this
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Take an ounce of the best Peruvian bark; Virginian
snake-root, and orange-peel, of each half an
ounce; bruise them all together, and infuse for five
or six days in a bottle of brandy, Holland gin, or
any good spirit; afterwards pour off the clear liquor;
and take a wine glass of it twice or thrice a day.
This indeed is recommending a dram; but the bitter
ingredients in a great measure take off the ill
effects of the spirit. Those who do not chuse it in
brandy, may infuse it in wine; and such as can bring
themselves to chew the bark, will find that method
succeed very well. Gentian root, or calamus aromaticus,
may also be chewed by turns for the same
purpose. All bitters seem to be antidotes to agues,
especially those that are warm and astringent.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF AN ACUTE CONTINUAL FEVER.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This fever is denominated acute, ardent, or
inflammatory. It most commonly attacks the
young, or persons about the prime or vigour of life,
especially such as live high, abound with blood, and
whose fibres are strong and elastic. It seizes people
at all seasons of the year; but is most frequent in
the spring and beginning of summer.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——An ardent fever may be occasioned
by any thing that overheats the body, or produces
plethora, as violent exercise, sleeping in the sun,
drinking strong liquors, eating spiceries, a full diet,
with little exercise, &#38;c. It may likewise be occasioned
by whatever obstructs the perspiration, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>lying on the damp ground, drinking cold liquor
when the body is hot, night-watching, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.—A rigour or chilliness generally
ushers in this fever, which is soon succeeded by great
heat, a frequent and full pulse, pain of the head, dry
skin, redness of the eyes, a florid countenance, pains
in the back, loins, &#38;c. To these succeed difficulty of
breathing, sickness, with an inclination to vomit.
The patient complains of great thirst, has no appetite
for solid food, is restless, and his tongue generally
appears black and rough.</p>

<p class='c008'>A delirium, excessive restlessness, great oppression
of the breast, with laborious respiration, starting of
the tendons, hiccup, cold clammy sweats, and an involuntary
discharge of urine, are very dangerous
symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this disease is always attended with danger,
the best medical assistance ought to be procured as
soon as possible. A physician may be of use at the
beginning, but his skill is often of no avail afterwards.
Nothing can be more unaccountable than
the conduct of those who have it in their power, at
the beginning of a fever, to procure the best medical
assistance, yet put it off till things come to an
extremity. When the disease, by delay or wrong
treatment, has become incurable, and has exhausted
the strength of the patient, it is in vain to hope for
relief from medicine. Physicians may indeed assist
Nature; but their attempts must ever prove fruitless,
when she is no longer able to co-operate with
their endeavours.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.—From the symptoms of this disease,
it is evident, that the blood and other humours
require to be diluted; that the perspiration, urine,
saliva, and all the other secretions, are in too small
quantity; that the vessels are rigid, and the heat of
the whole body too great: all these clearly point
out the necessity of a regimen calculated to dilute
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>the blood, correct the acrimony of the humours,
allay the excessive heat, remove the spasmodic stricture
of the vessels, and promote the secretions.</p>

<p class='c008'>These important purposes may be greatly promoted
by drinking plentifully of diluting liquors;
as water-gruel, or oatmeal-tea, clear whey, barley-water,
balm-tea, apple-tea, &#38;c. These may be
sharpened with juice of orange, jelly of currants,
raspberries, and such like: orange-whey is likewise
an excellent cooling drink. It is made by boiling
among milk and water a bitter orange sliced, till
the curd separates. If no orange can be had, a lemon,
a little cream of tartar, or a few spoonfuls of
vinegar, will have the same effect. Two or three
spoonfuls of white wine may occasionally be added
to the liquor when boiling.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be costive, an ounce of tamarinds,
with two ounces of stoned raisins of the sun, and a
couple of figs, may be boiled in three English pints
of water to a quart. This makes a very pleasant
drink, and may be used at discretion. The common
pectoral decoction is likewise a very proper drink in
this disease. A tea-cupful of it may be taken every
two hours, or oftener, if the patient’s heat and thirst
be very great<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c010'><sup>[65]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above liquids must all be drank a little warm.
They may be used in smaller quantities at the beginning
of a fever, but more freely afterwards, in order
to assist in carrying off the disease by promoting the
different excretions. We have mentioned a variety
of drinks, that the patient may have it in his power
to chuse those which are most agreeable; and that
when tired of one, he may have recourse to another.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s diet must be very spare and light.
All sorts of flesh-meats, and even chicken-broths,
are to be avoided. He may be allowed groat-gruel,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>panado, or light bread boiled in water; to which
may be added a few grains of common salt, and a
little sugar, which will render it more palatable.
He may eat roasted apples with a little sugar, toasted
bread with jelly of currants, boiled prunes, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will greatly relieve the patient, especially in
an hot season, to have fresh air frequently let into
his chamber. This, however, must always be done
in such a manner as not to endanger his catching
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is too common in fevers to load the patient
with bed-clothes, under the pretence of making him
sweat, or defending him from the cold. This custom
has many ill effects. It increases the heat of
the body, fatigues the patient, and retards, instead
of promoting, the perspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sitting upright in bed, if the patient is able to
bear it, will often have a good effect. It relieves
the head, by retarding the motion of the blood to
the brain. But this posture ought never to be continued
too long: and if the patient is inclined to
sweat, it will be more safe to let him lie, only raising
his head a little with pillows.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sprinkling the chamber with vinegar, juice of
lemon, or vinegar and rose-water, with a little nitre
dissolved in it, will greatly refresh the patient.
This ought to be done frequently, especially if the
weather is hot.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s mouth should be often washed with
a mixture of water and honey, to which a little vinegar
may be added, or with a decoction of figs
in barley-water. His feet and hands ought likewise
frequently to be bathed in lukewarm water;
especially if the head is affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should be kept as quiet and easy as
possible. Company, noise, and every thing that
disturbs the mind, is hurtful. Even too much
light, or any thing that affects the senses, ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>to be avoided. His attendants should be as few as
possible, and they ought not to be too often changed.
His inclinations ought rather to be soothed than contradicted;
even the promise of what he craves will
often satisfy him as much as its reality.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——In this and all other fevers,
attended with a hard, full, quick pulse, bleeding
is of the greatest importance. This operation ought
always to be performed as soon as the symptoms of an
inflammatory fever appear. The quantity of blood
to be taken away, however, must be in proportion
to the strength of the patient and the violence of the
disease. If after the first bleeding the fever should
increase, and the pulse become more frequent and
hard, there will be a necessity for repeating it a second,
and perhaps a third, or even a fourth time,
which may be done at the distance of twelve, eighteen,
or twenty-four hours from each other, as the symptoms
require. If the pulse continues soft, and the
patient is tolerably easy after the first bleeding, it
ought not to be repeated.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the heat and fever be very great, forty or fifty
drops of the dulcified or sweet spirit of nitre may
be made into a draught, with an ounce of rose-water,
two ounces of common water, and half an ounce of
simple syrup, or a bit of loaf-sugar. This draught
may be given to the patient every three or four hours
while the fever is violent; afterwards once in five
or six hours will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be afflicted with <a id='t161'></a>retching, or an inclination
to vomit, it will be right to assist Nature’s
attempts, by giving him weak camomile-tea, or lukewarm
water to drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the body is bound, a clyster of milk and water
with a little salt, and a spoonful of sweet oil or
fresh butter in it, ought daily to be administered.
Should this not have the desired effect, a tea-spoonful
of magnesia alba, or cream of tartar, may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>frequently put into his drink. He may likewise eat
tamarinds, boiled prunes, roasted apples, and the
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>If about the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth day, the
pulse becomes more soft, the tongue moister, and
the urine begins to let fall a reddish settlement,
there is reason to expect a favourable issue to the
disease. But if, instead of these symptoms, the patient’s
spirits grow languid, his pulse sinks, and his
breathing becomes difficult; with a stupor, trembling
of the nerves, starting of the tendons, &#38;c.
there is reason to fear that the consequences will be
fatal. In this case blistering plasters must be applied
to the head, ancles, inside of the legs or
thighs, as there may be occasion; poultices of
wheat-bread, mustard, and vinegar, may likewise
be applied to the soles of the feet, and the patient
must be supported with cordials, as strong wine-whey,
negus, sago-gruel with wine in it, and such
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proper regimen is not only necessary during
the fever, but likewise after the patient begins to
recover. By neglecting this, many relapse, or fall
into other diseases, and continue valetudinary for
life. Though the body is weak after a fever, yet
the diet for some time ought to be rather light
than of too nourishing a nature. Too much food,
drink, exercise, company, &#38;c. are carefully to
be avoided. The mind ought likewise to be
kept easy, and the patient should not attempt to
pursue study, or any business that requires intense
thinking.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the digestion is bad, or the patient is seized
at times with feverish heats, an infusion of Peruvian
bark in cold water will be of use. It will strengthen
the stomach, and help to subdue the remains of the
fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>When the patient’s strength is pretty well recovered,
he ought to take some gentle laxative. An
ounce of tamarinds and a dram of sena may be
boiled for a few minutes in an English pint of water,
and an ounce of manna dissolved in the decoction;
afterwards it may be strained, and a tea-cupful drank
every hour till it operates. This dose may be repeated
twice or thrice, five or six days intervening
between each dose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who follow laborious employments ought
not to return too soon to their labour after a fever,
but should keep easy till their strength and spirits
are sufficiently recruited.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XVI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE PLEURISY.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The true pleurisy is an inflammation of that
membrane called the <i>pleura</i>, which lines the
inside of the breast. It is distinguished into the
moist and dry. In the former the patient spits
freely; in the latter, little or none at all. There
is likewise a species of this disease, which is called
the <i>spurious</i> or <i>bastard pleurisy</i>, in which the pain is
more external, and chiefly affects the muscles between
the ribs. The pleurisy prevails among labouring
people, especially such as work without doors,
and are of a sanguine constitution. It is most frequent
in the spring season.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The pleurisy may be occasioned
by whatever obstructs the perspiration; as cold
northerly winds; drinking cold liquors when the
body is hot; sleeping without doors on the damp
ground; wet clothes; plunging the body into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>cold water, or exposing it to the cold air, when
covered with sweat, &#38;c. It may likewise be occasioned
by drinking strong liquors; by the stoppage
of usual evacuations; as old ulcers, issues,
sweating of the feet or hands, &#38;c. the sudden striking
in of any eruption, as the itch, the measles, or the
small-pox. Those who have been accustomed to
bleed at a certain season of the year are apt, if they
neglect it, to be seized with a pleurisy. Keeping the
body too warm by means of fire, clothes, &#38;c. renders
it more liable to this disease. A pleurisy may likewise
be occasioned by violent exercise, as running,
wrestling, leaping, or by supporting great weight,
blows on the breast, &#38;c. A bad conformation of
the body renders persons more liable to this disease,
as a narrow chest, a straitness of the arteries of the
pleura, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.—This, like most other fevers,
generally begins with chillness and shivering, which
are followed by heat, thirst, and restlessness. To
these succeeds a violent pricking pain in one of the
sides among the ribs. Sometimes the pain extends
towards the back bone, sometimes towards the fore-part
of the breast, and at other times towards the
shoulder blades. The pain is generally most violent
when the patient draws his breath.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pulse in this disease is commonly quick and
hard, the urine high-coloured; and if blood be
let, it is covered with a tough crust, or buffy coat.
The patient’s spittle is at first thin, but afterwards
it becomes grosser, and is often streaked with
blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Nature generally endeavours
to carry off this disease by a critical discharge of
blood from some part of the body, by expectoration,
sweat, loose stools, thick urine, or the like.
We ought therefore to second her intentions by
lessening the force of the circulation, relaxing the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>vessels, diluting the humours, and promoting expectoration.</p>

<p class='c008'>For these purposes the diet, as in the former disease,
ought to be cool, slender, and diluting. The
patient must avoid all food that is viscid, hard of
digestion, or that affords much nourishment; as
flesh, butter, cheese, eggs, milk, and also every
thing that is of a heating nature. His drink may
be whey, or an infusion of pectoral and balsamic
vegetables<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c010'><sup>[66]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barley-water, with a little honey or jelly of currants
mixed with it, is likewise a very proper
drink in this disease. It is made by boiling an
ounce of pearl-barley in three English pints of
water to two, which must afterwards be strained.
The decoction of figs, raisins, barley, recommended
in the preceding disease, is here likewise
very proper. These and other diluting liquors are
not to be drank in large quantities at a time, but
the patient ought to keep continually sipping them,
so as to render his mouth and throat always moist.
All his food and drink should be taken a little
warm.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should be kept quiet, cool, and
every way easy, as directed under the foregoing
disease. His feet and hands ought daily to be
bathed in lukewarm water; and he may sometimes
sit up in bed for a short space, in order to relieve
his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Almost every person knows,
when a fever is attended with a violent pain of the
side, and a quick hard pulse, that bleeding is necessary.
When these symptoms come on, the sooner
this operation is performed the better; and the
quantity at first must be pretty large, provided the
patient is able to bear it. A large quantity of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>blood let at once, in the beginning of a pleurisy,
has a much better effect than repeated small bleedings.
A man may lose twelve or fourteen ounces
of blood as soon as it is certainly known that he is
seized with a pleurisy. For a younger person, or
one of a delicate constitution, the quantity must
be less.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, after the first bleeding, the stitch, with the
other violent symptoms, should still continue, it
will be necessary, at the distance of twelve or
eighteen hours, to let eight or nine ounces more.
If the symptoms do not then abate, and the blood
shews a strong buffy coat, a third or even a fourth
bleeding may be requisite. If the pain of the side
abates, the pulse becomes softer, or the patient begins
to spit freely, bleeding ought not to be repeated.
This operation is seldom necessary after
the third or fourth day of the fever, and ought
not then to be performed, unless in the most urgent
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c008'>The blood may be many ways attenuated without
bleeding. There are likewise many things that
may be done to ease the pain of the side without
this operation, as fomenting, blistering, &#38;c. Fomentations
may be made by boiling a handful of
the flowers of elder, camomile, and common mallows,
or any other soft vegetables, in a proper
quantity of water. The herbs may be either put
into a flannel bag, and applied warm to the side,
or flannels may be dipped in the decoction, afterwards
wrung out, and applied to the part affected,
with as much warmth as the patient can easily bear.
As the clothes grow cool, they must be changed,
and great care taken that the patient do not catch
cold. A bladder may be filled with warm milk and
water, and applied to the side, if the above method
of fomenting be found inconvenient. Fomentations
not only ease the pain, but relax the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>vessels, and prevent the stagnation of the blood
and other humours. The side may likewise be frequently
rubbed with a little of the volatile liniment<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c010'><sup>[67]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Topical bleeding has often a very good effect in
this disease. It may either be performed by applying
a number of leeches to the part affected, or
by cupping, which is both a more certain and expeditious
method than the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leaves of various plants might likewise be applied
to the patient’s side with advantage. I have
often seen great benefit from young cabbage-leaves
applied warm to the side in a pleurisy. These not
only relax the parts, but likewise draw off a little
moisture, and may prevent the necessity of blistering-plasters;
which however, when other things
fail, must be applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the stitch continues after repeated bleedings,
fomentations, &#38;c. a blistering-plaster must be applied
over the part affected, and suffered to remain
for two days. This not only procures a discharge
from the side, but takes off the spasm, and by that
means assists in removing the cause of the disease.
To prevent a strangury when the blistering-plaster
is on, the patient may drink freely of the Arabic
emulsion<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c010'><sup>[68]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient is costive, a clyster of thin water-gruel,
or of barley-water, in which a handful of
mallows, or any other emollient vegetable has been
boiled, may be daily administered. This will not
only empty the bowels, but have the effect of a
warm fomentation applied to the inferior viscera,
which will help to make a derivation from the
breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The expectoration of spitting may be promoted
by sharp, oily, and mucilaginous medicines. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>this purpose an ounce of the oxymel, or the vinegar
of squills, may be added to six ounces of the pectoral
decoction, and two table-spoonfuls of it taken
every two hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should the squill disagree with the stomach, the
oily emulsion may be administered<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c010'><sup>[69]</sup></a>; or, in place
of it, two ounces of the oil of sweet almonds, or oil
of olives, and two ounces of the syrup of violets,
may be mixed with as much sugar-candy powdered,
as will make an electuary of the consistence of honey.
The patient may take a tea-spoonful of this
frequently, when the cough is troublesome. Should
oily medicines prove nauseous, which is sometimes
the case, two table-spoonfuls of the solution of gum
ammoniac in barley-water may be given three or four
times a-day<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c010'><sup>[70]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient does not perspire, but has a burning
heat upon his skin, and passes very little water,
some small doses of purified nitre and camphire
will be of use. Two drams of the former may be
rubbed with five or six grains of the latter in a mortar,
and the whole divided into six doses, one of
which may be taken every five or six hours, in a
little of the patient’s ordinary drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall only mention one medicine more, which
some reckon almost a specific in the pleurisy, <i>viz.</i>
the decoction of the seneka rattle-snake root<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c010'><sup>[71]</sup></a>.
After bleeding and other evacuations have been
premised, the patient may take two, three, or
four table-spoonfuls of this decoction, according
as his stomach will bear it, three or four times
a-day. If it should occasion vomiting, two or
three ounces of simple cinnamon-water may be
mixed with the quantity of decoction here directed,
or it may be taken in smaller doses. As this medicine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>promotes perspiration and urine, and likewise
keeps the body easy, it may be of some service
in a pleurisy, or any other inflammation of the
breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>No one will imagine that these medicines are all
to be used at the same time. We have mentioned
different things, on purpose that people may have
it in their power to chuse; and likewise, that when
one cannot be obtained, they may make use of another.
Different medicines are no doubt necessary
in the different periods of a disorder; and where
one fails of success, or disagrees with the patient,
it will be proper to try another.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is called the crisis, or height of the fever,
is sometimes attended with very alarming symptoms,
as difficulty of breathing, an irregular pulse,
convulsive motions, &#38;c. These are apt to frighten
the attendants, and induce them to do improper
things, as bleeding the patient, giving him strong
stimulating medicines, or the like. But they are
only the struggles of Nature to overcome the disease,
in which she ought to be assisted by plenty of
diluting drink, which is then peculiarly necessary.
If the patient’s strength however be much exhausted
by the disease, it will be necessary at this time to
support him with frequent small draughts of wine-whey,
negus, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the pain and fever are gone, it will be proper,
after the patient has recovered sufficient strength,
to give him some gentle purges, as those directed
towards the end of the acute continual fever. He
ought likewise to use a light diet, of easy digestion,
and his drink should be butter-milk, whey, and
other things of a cleansing nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the BASTARD PLEURISY.</p>

<p class='c008'>That species of pleurisy which is called the <i>bastard</i>
or <i>spurious</i>, generally goes off by keeping warm for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>a few days, drinking plenty of diluting liquors, and
observing a cooling regimen.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is known by a dry cough, a quick pulse, and
a difficulty of lying on the affected side, which last
does not always happen in the true pleurisy. Sometimes
indeed this disease proves obstinate, and requires
bleeding, with cupping, and scarifications of
the part affected. These, together with the use of
nitrous and other cooling medicines, seldom fail to
effect a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Of the PARAPHRENITIS.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>paraphrenitis</i>, or inflammation of the diaphragm,
is so nearly connected with the pleurisy, and
resembles it so much in the manner of treatment,
that it is scarce necessary to consider it as a separate
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is attended with a very acute fever, and an extreme
pain in the part affected, which is generally
augmented by coughing, sneezing, drawing in the
breath, taking food, going to stool, making water,
&#38;c. Hence the patient breathes quick, and draws
in his bowels to prevent the motion of the diaphragm;
is restless, anxious, has a dry cough, a hiccup, and
often a delirium. A convulsive laugh, or rather a
kind of involuntary grin, is no uncommon symptom
of this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every method must be taken to prevent a suppuration,
as it is impossible to save the patient’s life
when this happens. The regimen and medicine are
in all respects the same as in the pleurisy. We shall
only add, that in this disease emollient clysters are
peculiarly useful, as they relax the bowels, and
by that means make a derivation from the part
affected.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XVII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF A PERIPNEUMONY, OR INFLAMMATION OF THE LUNGS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As this disease affects an organ which is absolutely
necessary to life, it must always be attended with
danger. Persons who abound with thick blood,
whose fibres are tense and rigid, who feed upon gross
aliment, and drink strong viscid liquors, are most
liable to a peripneumony. It is generally fatal to
those who have a flat breast, or narrow chest, and to
such as are afflicted with an asthma, especially in the
decline of life. Sometimes the inflammation reaches
to one lobe of the lungs only, at other times the
whole of the organ is affected; in which case the
disease can hardly fail to prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease proceeds from a viscid pituitous
matter obstructing the vessels of the lungs, it is called
a <i>spurious</i> or <i>bastard peripneumony</i>. When it
arises from a thin acrid defluxion on the lungs, it is
denominated a <i>catarrhal peripneumony</i>, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——An inflammation of the lungs is
sometimes a primary disease, and sometimes it is the
consequence of other diseases, as a quinsey, a pleurisy,
&#38;c. It proceeds from the same causes as the
pleurisy, <i>viz.</i> an obstructed perspiration from cold,
wet clothes, &#38;c. or from an increased circulation of
the blood by violent exercise, the use of spiceries,
ardent spirits, and such like. The pleurisy and
peripneumony are often complicated; in which case
the disease is called a <i>pleuro-peripneumony</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——Most of the symptoms of a
pleurisy likewise attend an inflammation of the lungs;
only in the latter the pulse is more soft, and the pain
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>less acute; but the difficulty of breathing, and oppression
of the breast, are generally greater.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——As the regimen and medicine
are in all respects the same in the true peripneumony
as in the pleurisy, we shall not here repeat them, but
refer the reader to the treatment of that disease. It
may not however be improper to add, that the aliment
ought to be more slender and thin in this than
in any other inflammatory disease. The learned Dr.
Arbuthnot asserts, that even common whey is sufficient
to support the patient, and that decoctions of
barley, and infusions of fennel roots in warm water
with milk, are the most proper both for drink and
nourishment. He likewise recommends the steam
of warm water taken in by the breath, which serves
as a kind of internal fomentation, and helps to attenuate
the impacted humours. If the patient has
loose stools, but is not weakened by them, they are
not to be stopped, but rather promoted by the use
of emollient clysters.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed, that the <i>spurious</i> or
<i>bastard</i> peripneumony is occasioned by a viscid pituitous
matter obstructing the vessels of the lungs. It
commonly attacks the old, infirm, and phlegmatic,
in winter and wet seasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient at the beginning is cold and hot by
turns, has a small quick pulse, feels sense of weight
upon his breast, breathes with difficulty, and sometimes
complains of a pain and giddiness of his head.
His urine is usually pale, and his colour very little
changed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet in this, as well as in the true peripneumony,
must be very slender, as weak broths,
sharpened with the juice of orange or lemon, and
such like. His drink may be thin water-gruel
sweetened with honey, or a decoction of the roots of
fennel, liquorice, and quick grass. An ounce of
each of these may be boiled in three English pints
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>of water to a quart, and sharpened with a little currant-jelly,
or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding and purging are generally proper at the
beginning of this disease; but if the patient’s spittle
is pretty thick, or well concocted, neither of them
are necessary. It will be sufficient to assist the expectoration
by some of the sharp medicines recommended
for that purpose in the pleurisy, as the solution
of gum ammoniac with oxymel of squills, &#38;c.
Blistering plasters have generally a good effect, and
ought to be applied pretty early.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient does not spit, he must be bled according
as his strength will permit, and have a
gentle purge administered. Afterwards his body
may be kept open by clysters, and the expectoration
promoted, by taking every four hours two table-spoonfuls
of the solution mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an inflammation of the breast does not
yield to bleeding, blistering, and other evacuations,
it commonly ends in a suppuration, which is more
or less dangerous, according to the part where it is
situated. When this happens in the pleura, it sometimes
breaks outwardly, and the matter is discharged
by the wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the suppuration happens within the substance
or body of the lungs, the matter may be discharged
by expectoration; but if the matter floats in
the cavity of the breast, between the pleura and the
lungs, it can only be discharged by an incision made
betwixt the ribs.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient’s strength does not return after the
inflammation is to all appearance removed; if his
pulse continues quick though soft, his breathing
difficult and oppressed; if he has cold shiverings at
times, his cheeks flushed, his lips dry; and if he
complains of thirst, and want of appetite, there is
reason to fear a suppuration, and that a phthisis or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>consumption of the lungs will ensue. We shall
therefore next proceed to consider the proper treatment
of that disease.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XVIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF CONSUMPTIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A consumption is a wasting or decay of
the whole body from an ulcer, tubercles, or
concretions of the lungs, an empyema, a nervous
atrophy, or a cachexy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Arbuthnot observes, that in his time consumptions
made up above one-tenth part of the
bills of mortality in and about London. There is
reason to believe they have rather increased since,
and we know from experience, that they are not
less fatal in some other towns of England than in
London.</p>

<p class='c008'>Young persons, between the age of fifteen and
thirty, of a slender make, long neck, high shoulders,
and flat breasts, are most liable to this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Consumptions prevail more in England than in
any other part of the world, owing perhaps to the
great use of animal food and malt liquors, the general
application to sedentary employments, and the
great quantity of pit-coal which is there burnt; to
which we may add the perpetual changes in the atmosphere,
or variableness of the weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——It has already been observed, that
an inflammation of the breast often ends in an imposthume:
consequently whatever disposes people
to this disease, must likewise be considered as a cause
of consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>Other diseases, by vitiating the habit, may likewise
occasion consumptions; as the scurvy, the scrophula,
or king’s evil, the venereal disease, the asthma,
small-pox, measles, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this disease is seldom cured, we shall endeavour
the more particularly to point out its causes,
in order that people may be enabled to avoid it.
These are:</p>

<p class='c008'>——Confined or unwholesome air. When this
fluid is impregnated with the fumes of metals or
minerals, it proves extremely hurtful to the lungs,
and often corrodes the tender vessels of that necessary
organ.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Violent passions, exertions, or affections of the
mind; as grief, disappointment, anxiety, or close
application to the study of abstruse arts or sciences.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Great evacuations; as sweating, diarrhœas,
diabetes, excessive venery, the fluor albus, an over-discharge
of the menstrual flux, giving suck too
long, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>——The sudden stoppage of customary evacuations;
as the bleeding piles, sweating of the feet,
bleeding at the nose, the menses, issues, ulcers, or
eruptions of any kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Injuries done to the lungs, calculi, &#38;c. I
lately saw the symptoms of a phthisis occasioned by
a small bone sticking in the <i>bronchæ</i>. It was afterwards
vomited along with a considerable quantity of
purulent matter, and the patient, by a proper regimen,
and the use of the Peruvian bark, recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Making a sudden transition from a hot to a
very cold climate, change of apparel, or whatever
greatly lessens the perspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Frequent and excessive debaucheries. Late
watching, and drinking strong liquors, which generally
go together, can hardly fail to destroy the lungs.
Hence the <i>bon companion</i> generally falls a sacrifice to
this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>——Infection. Consumptions are likewise caught
by sleeping with the diseased; for which reason this
should be carefully avoided. It cannot be of great
benefit to the sick, and must hurt those in health.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Occupations in life. Those artificers who
sit much, and are constantly leaning forward, or pressing
upon the stomach and breast, as cutlers, taylors,
shoemakers, seamstresses, &#38;c. often die of
consumptions. They likewise prove fatal to singers,
and all who have occasion to make frequent and
violent exertions of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>——Cold. More consumptive patients date the
beginning of their disorders from wet feet, damp
beds, night air, wet clothes, or catching cold after
the body had been heated, than from all other causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sharp, saline, and aromatic aliments, which heat
and inflame the blood, are likewise frequently the
cause of consumptions.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall only add, that this disease is often owing
to an hereditary taint, or a scrophulous habit; in
which case it is generally incurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——This disease generally begins
with a dry cough, which often continues for some
months. If a disposition to vomit after eating be
excited by it, there is still greater reason to fear an
approaching consumption. The patient complains
of a more than usual degree of heat, a pain and oppression
of the breast, especially after motion; his
spittle is of a saltish taste, and sometimes mixed with
blood. He is apt to be sad; his appetite is bad,
and his thirst great. There is generally a quick,
soft, small pulse; though sometimes the pulse is
pretty full, and rather hard. These are the common
symptoms of a beginning consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>Afterwards the patient begins to spit a greenish,
white, or bloody matter. His body is extenuated
by the hectic fever, and colliquative sweats, which
mutually succeed one another, <i>viz.</i> the one towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>night, and the other in the morning. A looseness,
and an excessive discharge of urine, are often troublesome
symptoms at this time, and greatly weaken
the patient. There is a burning heat in the palms
of the hands, and the face generally flushes after eating;
the fingers become remarkably small, the nails
are bent inwards, and the hairs fall off.</p>

<p class='c008'>At last the swelling of the feet and legs, the total
loss of strength, the sinking of the eyes, the difficulty of
swallowing, and the coldness of the extremities,
shew the immediate approach of death, which however
the patient seldom believes to be so near.
Such is the usual progress of this fatal disease, which,
if not early checked, commonly sets all medicine at
defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——On the first appearance of a
consumption, if the patient lives in a large town, or
any place where the air is confined, he ought immediately
to quit it, and to make choice of a situation
in the country, where the air is pure and free.
Here he must not remain inactive, but take every
day as much exercise as he can bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best method of taking exercise is to ride on
horseback, as this gives the body a great deal of motion
without much fatigue. Such as cannot bear this
kind of exercise, must make use of a carriage. A
long journey, as it amuses the mind by a continual
change of objects, is greatly preferable to riding the
same ground over and over. Care however must be
taken to avoid catching cold from wet clothes, damp
beds, or the like. The patient ought always to finish
his ride in the morning, or at least before dinner;
otherwise it will oftener do harm than good.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is pity those who attend the sick seldom recommend
riding in this disease, till the patient is
either unable to bear it, or the malady has become incurable.
Patients are likewise apt to trifle with everything
that is in their own power. They cannot see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>how one of the common actions of life should prove
a remedy in an obstinate disease, and therefore they
reject it, while they greedily hunt after relief from
medicine, merely because they do not understand it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have strength and courage to undertake
a pretty long voyage, may expect great advantage
from it. This, to my knowledge, has frequently
cured a consumption after the patient was, to all
appearance, far advanced in that disease, and where
medicine had proved ineffectual. Hence it is
reasonable to conclude, that if a voyage were undertaken
in due time, it would seldom fail to perform
a cure<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c010'><sup>[72]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as try this method of cure ought to carry as
much fresh provisions along with them as will serve
for the whole time they are at sea. As milk is not
easily obtained in this situation, they ought to live
upon fruits, and the broth of chickens, or other young
animals which can be kept alive on board. It is scarce
necessary to add, that such voyages should be undertaken,
if possible, in the mildest season, and that they
ought to be towards a warmer climate<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c010'><sup>[73]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who have not courage for a long voyage
may travel into a more southern climate, as the
south of France, Spain, or Portugal; and if they
find the air of these countries agree with them, they
should continue there, at least till their health be
confirmed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>Next to proper air and exercise, we would recommend
a due attention to diet. The patient
should eat nothing that is either heating or hard of
digestion, and his drink must be of a soft and cooling
nature. All the diet ought to be calculated to
lessen the acrimony of the humours, and to nourish
and support the patient. For this purpose he must
keep chiefly to the use of vegetables and milk. Milk
alone is of more value in this disease than the whole
<i>materia medica</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Asses milk is commonly reckoned preferable to
any other; but it cannot always be obtained; besides,
it is generally taken in a very small quantity;
whereas, to produce any effects, it ought to make a
considerable part of the patient’s diet. It is hardly
to be expected, that a gill or two of asses milk, drank
in the space of twenty-four hours, should be able to
produce any considerable change in the humours of
an adult; and when people do not perceive its effects
soon, they lose hope, and so leave it off. Hence it
happens that this medicine, however valuable, very
seldom performs a cure. The reason is obvious; it
is commonly used too late, is taken in too small quantities,
and is not duly persisted in.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have known very extraordinary effects from asses
milk in obstinate coughs, which threatened a consumption
of the lungs; and do verily believe, if used
at this period, that it would seldom fail; But if it be
delayed till an ulcer is formed, which is generally
the case, how can it be expected to succeed?</p>

<p class='c008'>Asses milk ought to be drank, if possible, in its natural
warmth, and, by a grown person, in the quantity
of half an English pint at a time. Instead of
taking this quantity night and morning only, the
patient ought to take it four times, or at least thrice
a-day, and to eat a little light bread along with it,
so as to make it a kind of meal.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>If the milk should happen to purge, it may be
mixed with old conserve of roses. When that cannot
be obtained, the powder of crabs claws may be
used in its stead. Asses milk is usually ordered to
be drank warm in bed; but as it generally throws
the patient in a sweat when taken in this way, it
would perhaps be better to give it after he rises.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some extraordinary cures in consumptive cases
have been performed by women’s milk. Could this
be obtained in sufficient quantity, we would recommend
it in preference to any other. It is better if
the patient can suck it from the breast, than to
drink it afterwards. I knew a man who was reduced
to such a degree of weakness in a consumption, as
not to be able to turn himself in bed. His wife was
at that time giving suck, and the child happening
to die, he sucked her breasts, not with a view to
reap any advantage from the milk, but to make her
easy. Finding himself however greatly benefited by
it, he continued to suck her till he became perfectly
well, and is at present a strong and healthy man.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some prefer butter-milk to any other, and it is
indeed a very valuable medicine, if the stomach be
able to bear it. It does not agree with every person
at first; and is therefore often laid aside without
a sufficient trial. It should at first be taken
sparingly, and the quantity gradually increased,
until it comes to be almost the sole food. I never
knew it succeed unless where the patient almost lived
upon it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cows milk is most readily obtained of any, and
though it be not so easily digested as that of asses
or mares, it may be rendered lighter by adding to
it an equal quantity of barley-water, or allowing it
to stand for some hours, and afterwards taking off
the cream. If it should notwithstanding prove
heavy on the stomach, a small quantity of brandy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>or rum, with a little sugar, may be added, which
will render it both more light and nourishing.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not to be wondered, that milk should for
some time disagree with a stomach that has not been
accustomed to digest any thing but flesh and strong
liquors, which is the case with many of those who
fall into consumptions. We do not however advise
those have been accustomed to animal food and
strong liquors, to leave them off all at once. This
might be dangerous. It will be necessary for such
to eat a little once a-day of the flesh of some young
animal, or rather to use the broth made of chickens,
veal, lamb, or such like. They ought likewise to
drink a little wine made into negus, or diluted
with twice or thrice its quantity of water, and to
make it gradually weaker till they can leave it off
altogether.</p>

<p class='c008'>These must be used only as preparatives to a diet
consisting chiefly of milk and vegetables, which the
sooner the patient can be brought to bear, the better.
Rice and milk, or barley and milk, boiled with a
little sugar, is very proper food. Ripe fruits roasted,
baked, or boiled, are likewise proper, as goose or
currant berry tarts, apples roasted, or boiled in milk,
&#38;c. The jellies, conserves, and preserves, &#38;c. of
ripe subacid fruits, ought to be eaten plentifully, as
the jelly of currants, conserve of roses, preserved
plums, cherries, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wholesome air, proper exercise, and a diet consisting
chiefly of these and other vegetables, with
milk, is the only course that can be depended on in
a beginning consumption. If the patient has strength
and sufficient resolution to persist in this course, he
will seldom be disappointed of a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a populous town in England<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c010'><sup>[74]</sup></a>, where consumptions
are very common, I have frequently seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>consumptive patients, who had been sent to the
country with orders to ride, and live upon milk and
vegetables, return in a few months quite plump, and
free from any complaint. This indeed was not always
the case, especially when the disease was hereditary,
or far advanced; but it was the only method
in which success was to be expected: where it failed,
I never knew medicine succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient’s strength and spirits flag, he must
be supported by strong broths, jellies, and such
like. Some recommend shell-fish in this disorder,
and with some reason, as they are nourishing and
restorative<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c010'><sup>[75]</sup></a>. All the food and drink ought however
to be taken in small quantities, lest an overcharge
of fresh chyle should oppress the lungs,
and too much accelerate the circulation of the
blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s mind ought to be kept as easy and
cheerful as possible. Consumptions are often occasioned,
and always aggravated, by a melancholy
cast of mind; for which reason music, cheerful
company, and every thing that inspires mirth, are
highly beneficial. The patient ought seldom to be
left alone, as brooding over his calamities is sure to
render them worse.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Though the cure of this disease
depends chiefly upon regimen and the patient’s
own endeavours, yet we shall mention a few things
which may be of service in relieving some of the more
violent symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the first stage of a consumption, the cough
may sometimes be appeased by bleeding; and the
expectoration may be promoted by the following
medicines. Take fresh squills, gum-ammoniac,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>and powdered cardamum seeds, of each a quarter
of an ounce; beat them together in a mortar, and
if the mass proves too hard for pills, a little of any
kind of syrup may be added to it. This may be
formed into pills of a moderate size, and four or five
of them taken twice or thrice a-day, according as
the patient’s stomach will bear them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>lac ammoniacum</i>, or milk of gum-ammoniac,
as it is called, is likewise a proper medicine in this
stage of the disease. It may be used as directed in
the pleurisy.</p>

<p class='c008'>A mixture made of equal parts of lemon-juice,
fine honey, and syrup of poppies, may likewise be
used. Four ounces of each of these may be simmered
together in a sauce-pan, over a gentle fire,
and a table-spoonful of it taken at any time when
the cough is troublesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is common in this stage of the disease to load
the patient’s stomach with oily and balsamic medicines.
These, instead of removing the cause of the
disease, tend rather to increase it, by heating the
blood, while they pall the appetite, relax the solids,
and prove every way hurtful to the patient. Whatever
is used for removing the cough, besides riding
and other proper regimen, ought to be medicines
of a sharp and cleaning nature; as oxymel, syrup
of lemon, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Acids seem to have peculiarly good effects in this
disease; they both tend to quench the patient’s thirst
and to cool the blood. The vegetable acids, as
apples, oranges, lemons, &#38;c. appear to be the most
proper. I have known patients suck the juice of
several lemons every day with manifest advantage,
and would for this reason recommend acid vegetables
to be taken in as great quantity as the stomach
will bear them.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the patient’s drink, we would recommend
infusions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>lesser centaury, camomile flowers, or water-trefoil.
These infusions may be drank at pleasure. They
strengthen the stomach, promote digestion, rectify
the blood, and at the same time answer all the purposes
of dilution, and quench thirst much better
than things that are luscious or sweet. But if the
patient spits blood, he ought to use, for his ordinary
drink, infusions or decoctions of the vulnerary roots,
plants, &#38;c.<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c010'><sup>[76]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'>There are many other mucilaginous plants and
seeds, of a healing and agglutinating nature, from
which decoctions or infusions may be prepared
with the same intention; as the orches, the quince-seed,
coltsfoot, linseed, sasaparilla, &#38;c. It is not
necessary to mention the different ways in which
these may be prepared. Simple infusion or boiling
is all that is necessary, and the dose may be at discretion.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conserve of roses is here peculiarly proper.
It may either be put into the decoction above prescribed,
or eaten by itself. No benefit is to be expected
from trifling doses of this medicine. I never
knew it of any service, unless where three or four
ounces at least were used daily for a considerable
time. In this way I have seen it produce very happy
effects, and would recommend it wherever there is a
discharge of blood from the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the spitting up of gross matter, oppression
of the breast, and the hectic symptoms, shew that an
imposthume is formed in the lungs, we would recommend
the Peruvian bark, that being the only
drug which has any chance to counteract the general
tendency which the humours then have to putrefaction.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ounce of the bark in powder may be divided
into eighteen or twenty doses, of which one may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>taken every three hours through the day, in a little
syrup, or a cup of horehound tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the bark should happen to purge, it may be
made into an electuary, with the conserve of roses,
thus: Take old conserve of roses a quarter of a
pound, Peruvian bark in powder an ounce, syrup
of orange or lemon, as much as will make it of
the consistence of honey. This quantity will serve
the patient four or five days, and may be repeated
as there is occasion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as cannot take the bark in substance, may
infuse it in cold water. This seems to be the best
menstruum for extracting the virtues of that drug.
Half an ounce of bark in powder may be infused
for twenty-four hours in half an English pint of
water. Afterwards let it be passed through a fine
strainer, and an ordinary tea-cupful of it taken three
or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would not recommend the bark while there
are any symptoms of an inflammation of the breast;
but when it is certainly known that matter is collected
there, it is one of the best medicines which can be
used. Few patients indeed have resolution enough
to give the bark a fair trial at this period of the disease,
otherwise we have reason to believe that some
benefit might be reaped from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it is evident that there is an imposthume
in the breast, and the matter can neither be spit up
nor carried off by absorption, the patient must endeavour
to make it break inwardly, by drawing in
the steams of warm water or vinegar with his
breath, coughing, laughing, or bawling aloud,
&#38;c. When it happens to burst within the lungs,
the matter may be discharged by the mouth.
Sometimes indeed the bursting of the vomica occasions
immediate death, by suffocating the patient.
When the quantity of matter is great, and the patient’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>strength exhausted, this is commonly the
case. At any rate the patient is ready to fall into
a swoon, and should have volatile salts or spirits
held to his nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the matter discharged be thick, and the cough
and breathing become easier, there may be some
hopes of a cure. The diet at this time ought to be
light, but restorative, as chicken-broths, sago-gruel,
rice-milk, &#38;c. the drink, butter-milk, or
whey, sweetened with honey. This is likewise a
proper time for using the Peruvian bark, which may
be taken as directed above.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the vomica or imposthume should discharge
itself into the cavity of the breast, betwixt the
pleura and the lungs, there is no way of getting
the matter out but by an incision, as has already
been observed. As this operation must always be
performed by a surgeon, it is not necessary here to
describe it. We shall only add, that it is not so
dreadful as people are apt to imagine, and that it
is the only chance the patient in this case has for
his life.</p>

<p class='c020'>A nervous consumption is a wasting
or decay of the whole body, without any considerable
degree of fever, cough, or difficulty of breathing.
It is attended with indigestion, weakness, and
want of appetite, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are of a fretful temper, who indulge
in spirituous liquors, or who breathe an unwholesome
air, are most liable to this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would chiefly recommend, for the cure of a
nervous consumption, a light and nourishing diet,
plenty of exercise in a free open air, and the use of
such bitters as brace and strengthen the stomach;
as the Peruvian bark, gentian root, camomile, horehound,
&#38;c. These may be infused in water or wine,
and a glass of it drank frequently.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>It will greatly assist the digestion, and promote
the cure of this disease, to take twice-a-day twenty
or thirty drops of the elixir of vitriol in a glass of
wine or water. The chalybeate wine is likewise an
excellent medicine in this case. It strengthens the
solids, and powerfully assists Nature in the preparation
of good blood<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c010'><sup>[77]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Agreeable amusements, cheerful company, and
riding about, are however preferable to all medicines
in this disease. For which reason, when the
patient can afford it, we would recommend a long
journey of pleasure, as the most likely means to
restore his health.</p>

<p class='c008'>What is called a <i>symptomatic consumption</i> cannot
be cured without first removing the disease by which
it is occasioned. Thus, when a consumption proceeds
from, the scrophula or king’s evil, from the
scurvy, the asthma, the venereal disease, &#38;c. a due
attention must be paid to the malady from whence
it arises, and the regimen and medicine directed
accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>When <i>excessive evacuations</i> of any kind occasion
a consumption, they must not only be restrained,
but the patient’s strength must be restored by gentle
exercise, nourishing diet, and generous cordials.
Young and delicate mothers often fall into consumptions,
by giving suck too long. As soon as
they perceive their strength and appetite begin to
fail, they ought immediately to wean the child, or
provide another nurse, otherwise they cannot expect
a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before we quit this subject, we would earnestly
recommend it to all, as they wish to avoid consumptions,
to take as much exercise without doors
as they can, to avoid unwholesome air, and to study
sobriety. Consumptions owe their present increase
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>not a little to the fashion of sitting up late, eating
hot suppers, and spending every evening over a
bowl of hot punch or other strong liquors. These
liquors, when too freely used, not only hurt the
digestion, and spoil the appetite, but heat and
inflame the blood, and set the whole constitution
on fire.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XIX.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE SLOW OR NERVOUS FEVER.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Nervous fevers have increased greatly of
late years in this island, owing doubtless to our
different manner of living, and the increase of sedentary
employments; as they commonly attack
persons of a weak relaxed habit, who neglect exercise,
eat little solid food, study hard, or indulge in
spirituous liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——Nervous fevers may be occasioned
by whatever depresses the spirits, or impoverishes
the blood; as grief, fear, anxiety, want of sleep,
intense thought, living on poor watery diet, unripe
fruits, cucumbers, melons, mushrooms, &#38;c. They
may likewise be occasioned by damp, confined, or
unwholesome air. Hence they are very common in
rainy seasons, and prove most fatal to those who live
in dirty low houses, crowded streets, hospitals, jails,
or such-like places.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons whose constitutions have been broken by
excessive venery, frequent salivations, too free an
use of purgative medicines, or any other excessive
evacuations, are most liable to this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping on wet clothes, lying on the damp
ground, excessive fatigue, and whatever obstructs
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the perspiration, or causes a spasmodic stricture of
the solids, may likewise occasion nervous fevers.
We shall only add, frequent and great irregularities
in diet. Too great abstinence, as well as
excess, is hurtful. Nothing tends so much to preserve
the body in a sound state as a regular diet;
nor can any thing contribute more to occasion fevers
of the worst kind than its opposite.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——Low spirits, want of appetite,
weakness, weariness after motion, watchfulness,
deep sighing, and dejection of mind, are generally
the forerunners of this disease. These are
succeeded by a quick low pulse, a dry tongue without
any considerable thirst, chillness and flushing in
turns, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>After some time the patient complains of a giddiness
and pain of the head, has a nausea, with
reachings and vomiting; the pulse is quick, and
sometimes intermitting; the urine pale, resembling
dead small-beer, and the breathing is difficult,
with oppression of the breast, and slight alienations
of mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>If towards the ninth, tenth, or twelfth day, the
tongue becomes more moist, with a plentiful spitting,
a gentle purging, or a moisture upon the
skin; or if a suppuration happens in one or both
ears, or large pustules break out about the lips
and nose, there is reason to hope for a favourable
crisis.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if there is an excessive looseness, or wasting
sweats, with frequent fainting fits; if the tongue,
when put out, trembles excessively, and the extremities
feel cold, with a fluttering or slow creeping
pulse; if there is a starting of the tendons, an almost
total loss of sight and hearing, and an involuntary
discharge by stool and urine, there is great
reason to fear that death is approaching.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>REGIMEN.——It is very necessary in this disease
to keep the patient cool and quiet. The least
motion would fatigue him, and will be apt to occasion
weariness, and even faintings. His mind
ought not only to be kept easy, but soothed and
comforted with the hopes of a speedy recovery.
Nothing is more hurtful in low fevers of this kind
than presenting to the patient’s imagination gloomy
or frightful ideas. These of themselves often occasion
nervous fevers, and it is not to be doubted
but they will likewise aggravate them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient must not be kept too low. His
strength and spirits ought to be supported by nourishing
diet and generous cordials. For this purpose
his gruel, panado, or whatever food he takes,
must be mixed with wine according as the symptoms
may require. Pretty strong wine-whey, or
small negus, sharpened with the juice of orange or
lemon, will be proper for his ordinary drink. Mustard-whey
is likewise a very proper drink in this
fever, and may be rendered an excellent cordial
medicine by the addition of a proper quantity of
white-wine<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c010'><sup>[78]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wine in this disease, if it could be obtained
genuine, is almost the only medicine that would
be necessary. Good wine possesses all the virtues of
the cordial medicines, while it is free from many
of their bad qualities. I say good wine; for however
common this article of luxury is now become,
it is rarely to be obtained genuine, especially by the
poor, who are obliged to purchase it in small quantities.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have often seen patients in low nervous fevers
where the pulse could hardly be felt, with a constant
delirium, coldness of the extremities, and almost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>every other mortal symptom, recover by using
in whey, gruel, and negus, a bottle or two of strong
wine every day. Good old sound claret is the best,
and may be made into negus, or given by itself, as
circumstances require.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a word, the great aim in this disease is to support
the patient’s strength, by giving him frequently
small quantities of the above, or other drinks of a
warm and cordial nature. He is not however
to be overheated either with liquor or clothes;
and his food ought to be light, and given in small
quantities.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Where a nausea, load, and
sickness at stomach, prevail at the beginning of the
fever, it will be necessary to give the patient a gentle
vomit. Fifteen or twenty grains of ipecacuanha
in fine powder, or a few spoonfuls of the vomiting
julep<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c010'><sup>[79]</sup></a>, will generally answer this purpose very well.
This may be repeated any time before the third or
fourth day, if the above symptoms continue. Vomits
not only clean the stomach, but, by the general
shock which they give, promote the perspiration,
and have many other excellent effects in slow
fevers, where there are no signs of inflammation, and
nature wants rousing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as dare not venture upon a vomit, may clean
the bowels by a small dose of Turkey rhubarb, or
an infusion of senna and manna.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all fevers, the great point is to regulate the
symptoms, so as to prevent them from going to either
extreme. Thus, in fevers of the inflammatory
kind, where the force of the circulation is too great,
or the blood dense, and the fibres too rigid,
bleeding and other evacuations are necessary. But
in nervous fevers, where nature flags, where the
blood is vapid and poor, and the solids relaxed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the lancet must be spared, and wine, with other
cordials, plentifully administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the more necessary to caution people against
bleeding in this disease, as there is generally at the
beginning an universal stricture upon the vessels,
and sometimes an oppression and difficulty of breathing,
which suggest the idea of a plethora, or too
great a quantity of blood. I have known even some
of the faculty deceived by their own feelings in this
respect, so far as to insist upon being bled, when it
was evident from the consequences that the operation
was improper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though bleeding is generally improper in this
disease, yet blistering is highly necessary. Blistering-plasters
may be applied at all times of the fever
with great advantage. If the patient is delirious,
he ought to be blistered on the neck or head, and
it will be the safest course, when the insensibility
continues, as soon as the discharge occasioned by
one blistering-plaster abates, to apply another to
some other part of the body, and by that means
keep up a continual succession of them till he be
out of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have been more sensible of the advantage of
blistering in this than in any other disease. Blistering-plasters
not only stimulate the solids to action,
but likewise occasion a continual discharge, which
may in some measure supply the want of critical
evacuations, which seldom happen in this kind of
fever. They are most proper, however, either towards
the beginning, or after some degree of stupor
has come on, in which last case it will always be
proper to blister the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient is costive through the course of the
disease, it will be necessary to procure a stool, by
giving him every other day a clyster of milk and
water, with a little sugar, to which may be added
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>a spoonful of common salt, if the above does not
operate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should a violent looseness come on, it may be
checked by small quantities of Venice treacle, or
giving the patient for his ordinary drink the white
decoction<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c010'><sup>[80]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>A miliary eruption sometimes breaks out about
the ninth or tenth day. As eruptions are often critical,
great care should be taken not to retard Nature’s
operation in this particular. The eruption
ought neither to be checked by bleeding nor other
evacuations, nor pushed out by a hot regimen; but
the patient should be supported by gentle cordials,
as wine-whey, small negus, sago-gruel with a little
wine in it, and such like. He ought not to be kept
too warm; yet a kindly breathing sweat should by
no means be checked.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though blistering and the use of cordial liquors
are the chief things to be depended on in this kind
of fever; yet, for those who may chuse to use them,
we shall mention one or two of the forms of medicine
which are commonly prescribed in it<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c010'><sup>[81]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In desperate cases, where the hiccup and starting
of the tendons have already come on, we have
sometimes seen extraordinary effects from large
doses of musk frequently repeated. Musk is doubtless
an antispasmodic, and may be given to the
quantity of a scruple three or four times a-day, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>oftener if necessary. Sometimes it may be proper
to add to the musk a few grains of camphire, and
salt of hartshorn, as these tend to promote perspiration
and the discharge of urine. Thus fifteen
grains of musk, with three grains of camphire, and
six grains of salt of hartshorn, may be made into a
bolus with a little syrup, and given as above.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the fever should happen to intermit, which it
frequently does towards the decline, or if the patient’s
strength should be wasted with colliquative
sweats, &#38;c. it will be necessary to give him the Peruvian
bark. Half a drachm, or a whole drachm,
if the stomach will bear it, of the bark in fine
powder, may be given four or five times a-day in a
glass of red port or claret. Should the bark in
substance not sit easy on the stomach, an ounce of
it in powder may be infused in a bottle of Lisbon
or Rhenish wine for two or three days, afterwards
it may be strained, and a glass of it taken frequently<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c010'><sup>[82]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some give the bark in this and other fevers, where
there are no symptoms of inflammation, without
any regard to the remission or intermission of the
fever. How far future observations may tend to
establish this practice, we will not pretend to say;
but we have reason to believe that the bark is a very
universal febrifuge, and that it may be administered
with advantage in most fevers where bleeding is not
necessary, or where there are no symptoms of topical
inflammation.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XX.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE MALIGNANT, PUTRID, OR SPOTTED FEVER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This may be called the <i>pestilential fever</i> of Europe,
as in many of its symptoms it bears a great
resemblance to that dreadful disease the plague.
Persons of a lax habit, a melancholy disposition, and
those whose vigour has been wasted by long fasting,
watching, hard labour, excessive venery, frequent
salivations, &#38;c. are most liable to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——This fever is occasioned by foul
air, from a number of people being confined in a
narrow place, not properly ventilated; from putrid
animal and vegetable effluvia, &#38;c. Hence it prevails
in camps, jails, hospitals and infirmaries, especially
where such places are too much crowded, and
cleanliness is neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>A close constitution of the air, with long rainy
or foggy weather, likewise occasions putrid fevers.
They often succeed great inundations in low and
marshy countries, especially when these are preceded
or followed by a hot and sultry season.</p>

<p class='c008'>Living too much upon animal food, without a
proper mixture of vegetables, or eating fish or flesh
that has been kept too long, are likewise apt to occasion
this kind of fever. Hence sailors on long
voyages, and the inhabitants of besieged cities, are
very often visited with putrid fevers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Corn that has been greatly damaged by rainy seasons,
or long keeping, and water which has become
putrid by stagnation, &#38;c. may likewise occasion this
fever.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Dead carcases tainting the air, especially in hot
seasons, are very apt to occasion putrid diseases.
Hence this kind of fever often prevails in countries
which are the scenes of war and bloodshed. This
shews the propriety of removing burying grounds,
slaughterhouses, &#38;c. at a proper distance from great
towns.</p>

<p class='c008'>Want of cleanliness is a very general cause of putrid
fevers. Hence they prevail amongst the poor
inhabitants of large towns, who breathe a confined
unwholesome air, and neglect cleanliness. Such
mechanics as carry on dirty employments, and are
constantly confined within doors, are likewise very
liable to this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall only add, that putrid, malignant, or
spotted fevers, are highly infectious, and are therefore
often communicated by contagion. For which
reason all persons ought to keep at a distance from
those affected with such diseases, unless their attendance
is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The malignant fever is generally
preceded by a remarkable weakness or loss
of strength, without any apparent cause. This is
sometimes so great, that the patient can scarce walk,
or even sit upright, without being in danger of
fainting away. His mind too is greatly dejected;
he sighs, and is full of dreadful apprehensions.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a nausea, and sometimes a vomiting of
bile; a violent pain of the head, with a strong pulsation
or throbbing of the temporal arteries; the
eyes often appear red and inflamed, with a pain at
the bottom of the orbit; there is a noise in the ears,
the breathing is laborious, and often interrupted
with a sigh; the patient complains of a pain about
the region of the stomach, and in his back and
loins; his tongue is at first white, but afterwards it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>appears black and chaped; and his teeth are covered
with a black crust. He sometimes passes
worms both upwards and downwards, is affected
with tremors or shaking, and often becomes delirious.</p>

<p class='c008'>If blood is let, it appears dissolved, or with a
very small degree of cohesion, and soon becomes
putrid; the stools smell extremely fœtid, and are
sometimes of a greenish, black, or reddish cast.
Spots of a pale purple, dun, or black colour, often
appear upon the skin, and sometimes there are violent
hæmorrhages, or discharges of blood from the
mouth, eyes, nose, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Putrid fevers may be distinguished from the inflammatory,
by the smallness of the pulse, the great
dejection of mind, the dissolved state of the blood,
the petechiæ, or purple spots, and the putrid smell
of the excrements. They may likewise be distinguished
from the low or nervous fever by the heat
and thirst being greater, the urine of a higher colour,
and the loss of strength, dejection of mind,
and all the other symptoms more violent.</p>

<p class='c008'>It sometimes happens, however, that the inflammatory,
nervous, and putrid symptoms are so blended
together, as to render it very difficult to determine
to which class the fever belongs. In this case the
greatest caution and skill are requisite. Attention
must be paid to those symptoms which are most
prevalent, and both the regimen and medicines
adapted to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Inflammatory and nervous fevers may be converted
into malignant and putrid, by too hot a regimen
or improper medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>The duration of putrid fevers is extremely uncertain;
sometimes they terminate between the seventh
and fourteenth day, and at other times they
are prolonged for five or six weeks. Their duration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>depends greatly upon the constitution of the
patient, and the manner of treating the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most favourable symptoms are, a gentle looseness
after the fourth or fifth day, with a warm mild
sweat. These, when continued for a considerable
time, often carry off the fever, and should never be
imprudently stopped. Small miliary pustules appearing
between the petechiæ or purple spots are
likewise favourable, as also hot scabby eruptions
about the mouth and nose. It is a good sign when
the pulse rises upon the use of wine, or other cordials,
and the nervous symptoms abate; deafness
coming on towards the decline of the fever, is
likewise often a favourable symptom<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c010'><sup>[83]</sup></a>, as are abscesses
in the groin or parotid glands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Among the unfavourable symptoms may be
reckoned an excessive looseness, with a hard swelled
belly; large black or livid blotches breaking out
upon the skin; apthæ in the mouth; cold clammy
sweats; blindness; change of the voice; a wild
flaring of the eyes; difficulty of swallowing; inability
to put out the tongue; and a constant inclination
to uncover the breast. When the sweat
and saliva are tinged with blood, and the urine is
black, or deposits a black sooty sediment, the patient
is in great danger. Starting of the tendons,
and fœtid, ichorous, involuntary stools, attended
with coldness of the extremities, are generally the
forerunners of death.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——In the treatment of this disease
we ought to endeavour as far as possible to counteract
the putrid tendency of the humours; to
support the patient’s strength and spirits; and to
assist Nature in expelling the cause of this disease,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>by gently promoting perspiration and the other evacuations.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been observed, that putrid fevers are often
occasioned by unwholesome air, and of course they
must be aggravated by it. Care should therefore
be taken to prevent the air from stagnating in the
patient’s chamber, to keep it cool, and renew it
frequently, by opening the doors or windows of
some adjacent apartment. The breath and perspiration
of persons in perfect health soon render the
air of a small apartment noxious; but this will
sooner happen from the perspiration and breath of
a person whose whole mass of humours are in a
putrid state.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides the frequent admission of fresh air, we
would recommend the use of vinegar, verjuice,
juice of lemon, Seville orange, or any kind of vegetable
acid that can be most readily obtained.
These ought frequently to be sprinkled upon the
floor, the bed, and every part of the room. They
may also be evaporated with a hot iron, or by boiling,
&#38;c. The fresh skins of lemons or oranges
ought likewise to be laid in different parts of the
room, and they should be frequently held to the
patient’s nose. The use of acids in this manner
would not only prove very refreshing to the patient,
but would likewise tend to prevent the infection
from spreading among those who attend him.
Strong scented herbs, as rue, tansy, rosemary, wormwood,
&#38;c. may likewise be laid in different parts of
the house, and smelled to by those who go near
the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient must not only be kept cool, but
likewise quiet and easy. The least noise will affect
his head, and the smallest fatigue will be apt to
make him faint.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things are of greater importance in this disease
than acids, which ought to be mixed with all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>the patient’s food as well as drink. Orange, lemon,
or vinegar whey, are all very proper, and may be
drank by turns, according to the patient’s inclination.
They may be rendered cordial by the addition
of wine in such quantity as the patient’s strength
seems to require. When he is very low, he may
drink negus, with only one half water, and sharpened
with the juice of orange or lemon. In some
cases a glass of wine may now and then be allowed.
The most proper wine is Rhenish; but if
the body be open, red port or claret is to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the body is bound, a tea-spoonful of the
cream of tartar may be put into a cup of the patient’s
drink, as there is occasion; or he may drink
a decoction of tamarinds, which will both quench
his thirst, and promote a discharge by stool.</p>

<p class='c008'>If camomile-tea will sit upon his stomach, it is
a very proper drink in this disease. It may be sharpened
by adding to every cup of the tea ten or fifteen
drops of the elixir of vitriol.</p>

<p class='c008'>The food must be light, as panado or groat-gruel,
to which a little wine may be added, if the patient
be weak and low; and they ought all to be sharpened
with the juice of orange, the jelly of currants,
or the like. The patient ought likewise to eat freely
of ripe fruits, as roasted apples, currant or gooseberry
tarts, preserved cherries, or plums, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Taking a little food or drink frequently, not only
supports the spirits, but counteracts the putrid tendency
of the humours; for which reason the patient
ought frequently to be sipping small quantities of
some of the acid liquors mentioned above, or any
that may be more agreeable to his palate, or more
readily obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>If he is delirious, his feet and hands ought to be
frequently fomented with a strong infusion of camomile
flowers. This, or an infusion of the bark, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>such as can afford it, cannot fail to have a good
effect. Fomentations of this kind not only relieve
the head, by relaxing the vessels in the extremities,
but as their contents are absorbed, and taken into
the system, they may assist in preventing the putrescency
of the humours.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——If a vomit be given at the
beginning of this fever, it will hardly fail to have
a good effect; but if the fever has gone on for some
days, and the symptoms are violent, vomits are
not quite so safe. The body however is always to
be kept gently open by clysters, or mild laxative
medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding is seldom necessary in putrid fevers. If
there be signs of an inflammation, it may sometimes
be permitted at the first onset; but the repetition of
it generally proves hurtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blistering plasters are never to be used unless in
the greatest extremities. If the petechiæ or spots
should suddenly disappear, the patient’s pulse sink
remarkably, and a delirium, with other bad symptoms,
come on, blistering may be permitted. In
this case the blistering plasters are to be applied to
the head, and inside of the legs or thighs. But as
they are sometimes apt to occasion a gangrene, we
would rather recommend warm cataplasms or poultices
of mustard and vinegar to be applied to the
feet, having recourse to blisters only in the utmost
extremities.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is common in the beginning of this fever to
give the emetic tartar in small doses, repeated every
second or third hour, till it shall either vomit, purge,
or throw the patient into a sweat. This practice
is very proper, provided it be not pushed so far
as to weaken the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very ridiculous notion has long prevailed, of
expelling the poisonous matter of malignant diseases
by trifling doses of cordial or alexipharmic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>medicines. In consequence of this notion, the
contrayerva-root, the cordial confection, the mithridate,
&#38;c. have been extolled as infallible remedies.
There is reason however to believe, that
these seldom do much good. Where cordials are
necessary, we know none that is superior to good
wine; and therefore again recommend it both as
the safest and best. Wine, with acids and antiseptics,
are the only things to be relied on in the
cure of malignant fevers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the most dangerous species of this disease,
when it is attended with purple, livid, or black
spots, the Peruvian bark must be administered. I
have seen it, when joined with acids, prove successful,
even in cases where the petechiæ had the
most threatening aspect. But, to answer this purpose,
it must not only be given in large doses, but
duly persisted in.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best method of administering the bark is
certainly in substance. An ounce of it in powder
may be mixed with half an English pint of water,
and the same quantity of red wine, and sharpened
with the elixir or the spirit of vitriol, which will
both make it sit easier on the stomach, and render
it more beneficial. Two or three ounces of the
syrup of lemon may be added, and two table-spoonfuls
of the mixture taken every two hours, or
oftener, if the stomach is able to bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who cannot take the bark in substance may
infuse it in wine, as recommended in the preceding
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there be a violent looseness, the bark must be
boiled in red wine with a little cinnamon, and sharpened
with the elixir of vitriol, as above. Nothing
can be more beneficial in this kind of looseness than
plenty of acids, and such things as promote a gentle
perspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>If the patient be troubled with vomiting, a dram
of the salt of wormwood, dissolved in an ounce and
half of fresh lemon-juice, and made into a draught
with an ounce of simple cinnamon water, and a bit
of sugar, may be given and repeated as often as it
is necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>If swellings of the glands appear, their suppuration
is to be promoted by the application of poultices,
ripening cataplasms, &#38;c. And as soon as there
is any appearance of matter in them, they ought to
be laid open, and the poultices continued.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have known large ulcerous sores break out in
various parts of the body, in the decline of this
fever, of a livid gangrenous appearance, and a most
putrid cadaverous smell. These gradually healed,
and the patient recovered, by the plentiful use of
Peruvian bark and wine, sharpened with the spirits
of vitriol.</p>

<p class='c008'>For preventing putrid fevers we would recommend
a strict regard to cleanliness; a dry situation;
sufficient exercise in the open air; wholesome food,
and a moderate use of generous liquors. Infection
ought above all things to be avoided. No constitution
is proof against it. I have known persons
seized with a putrid fever, by only making a single
visit to a patient in it; others have caught it by
lodging for one night in a town where it prevailed;
and some by attending the funerals of such as died
of it<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c010'><sup>[84]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>When a putrid fever seizes any person in a family,
the greatest attention is necessary to prevent the disease
from spreading. The sick ought to be placed
in a large apartment, as remote from the rest of the
family as possible; he ought likewise to be kept extremely
clean, and should have fresh air frequently
let into his chamber; whatever comes from him
should be immediately removed, his linen should
be frequently changed, and those in health ought to
avoid all unnecessary communication with him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any one who is apprehensive of having caught
the infection, ought immediately to take a vomit,
and to work it off by drinking plentifully of camomile-tea.
This may be repeated in a day or two,
if the apprehensions still continue, or any unfavourable
symptoms appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The person ought likewise to take an infusion of
the bark and camomile flowers for his ordinary drink;
and before he goes to bed, he may drink an English
pint of pretty strong negus, or a few glasses of
generous wine. I have been frequently obliged to
follow this course, when malignant fevers prevailed,
and have likewise recommended it to others with
constant success.</p>

<p class='c008'>People generally fly to bleeding and purging as
antidotes against infection; but these are so far
from securing them, that they often, by debilitating
the body, increase the danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who wait upon the sick in putrid fevers,
ought always to have a piece of spunge or a handkerchief
dipt in vinegar, or juice of lemon, to smell
to while near the patient. They ought likewise to
wash their hands, and, if possible, to change their
clothes, before they go into company.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE MILIARY FEVER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This fever takes its name from the small pustules
or bladders which appear on the skin, resembling,
in shape and size, the seeds of millet. The
pustules are either red or white, and sometimes
both are mixed together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The whole body is sometimes covered with pustules;
but they are generally more numerous where
the sweat is most abundant, as on the breast, the
back, &#38;c. A gentle sweat, or moisture on the skin,
greatly promotes the eruption; but, when the skin
is dry, the eruption is both more painful and dangerous.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes this is a primary disease; but it is
much oftener only a symptom of some other malady,
as the small-pox, measles, ardent, putrid, or nervous
fever, &#38;c. In all these cases it is generally the
effect of too hot a regimen or medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>The miliary fever chiefly attacks the idle and the
phlegmatic, or persons of a relaxed habit. The
young and the aged are more liable to it than those
in the vigour and prime of life. It is likewise more
incident to women than men, especially the delicate
and the indolent, who, neglecting exercise, keep
continually within doors, and live upon weak watery
diet. Such females are extremely liable to be seized
with this disease in child-bed, and often lose their
lives by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The miliary fever is sometimes
occasioned by violent passions or affections of the
mind; as excessive grief, anxiety, thoughtfulness,
&#38;c. It may likewise be occasioned by excessive
watching, great evacuations, a weak watery diet,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>rainy seasons, eating too freely of cold, crude, unripe
fruits, as plums, cherries, cucumbers, melons;
&#38;c. Impure waters, or provisions which have been
spoiled by rainy seasons, long keeping, &#38;c. may
likewise cause miliary fevers. They may also be
occasioned by the stoppage of any customary evacuation,
as issues, setons, ulcers, the bleeding piles
in men, or the menstrual flux in women, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease in child-bed-women is sometimes the
effect of great costiveness during pregnancy; it may
likewise be occasioned by their excessive use of green
trash, and other unwholesome things, in which
pregnant women are too apt to indulge. But its
most general cause is indolence. Such women as
lead a sedentary life, especially during pregnancy,
and at the same time live grossly, can hardly escape
this disease in child-bed. Hence it proves extremely
fatal to women of fashion, and likewise to those
women in manufacturing towns, who, in order to
assist their husbands, sit close within doors for almost
the whole of their time. But among women who
are active and laborious, who live in the country,
and take sufficient exercise without doors, this disease
is very little known.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——When this is a primary disease,
it makes its attack, like most other eruptive
fevers, with a slight shivering, which is succeeded
by heat, loss of strength, faintishness, sighing, a
low quick pulse, difficulty of breathing, with great
anxiety and oppression of the breast. The patient
is restless, and sometimes delirious; the tongue
appears white, and the hands shake, with often a
burning heat in the palms; and in child-bed-women
the milk generally goes away, and the other discharges
stop.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient feels an itching or pricking pain under
the skin, after which innumerable small pustules
of a red or white colour begin to appear. Upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>this the symptoms generally abate, the pulse becomes
more full and soft, the skin grows moister, and the
sweat, as the disease advances, begins to have a peculiar
fœtid smell; the great load on the breast, and
oppression of the spirits, generally go off, and the
customary evacuations gradually return. About
the sixth or seventh day from the eruption, the pustules
begin to dry and fall off, which occasions a
very disagreeable itching in the skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to ascertain the exact time when
the pustules will either appear or go off. They generally
come out on the third or fourth day, when
the eruption is critical; but, when symptomatic,
they may appear at any time of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the pustules appear and vanish by turns.
When that is the case, there is always danger; but
when they go in all of a sudden, and do not appear
again, the danger is very great.</p>

<p class='c008'>In child-bed-women the pustules are commonly at
first filled with clear water, afterwards they grow
yellowish. Sometimes they are interspersed with
pustules of a red colour. When these only appear
the disease goes by the name of a <i>rash</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——In all eruptive fevers, of whatever
kind, the chief point is to prevent the sudden
disappearing of the pustules, and to promote their
maturation. For this purpose the patient must be
kept in such a temperature, as neither to push out
the eruption too fast, nor to cause it to retreat prematurely.
The diet and drink ought therefore to
be in a moderate degree nourishing and cordial; but
neither strong nor heating. The patient’s chamber
ought neither to be kept too hot nor cold; and he
should not be too much covered with clothes. Above
all, the mind is to be kept easy and cheerful. Nothing
so certainly makes an eruption go in as fear,
or the apprehension of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>The food must be weak chicken-broth with bread,
panado, sago, or groat gruel, &#38;c. to a gill of which
may be added a spoonful or two of wine, as the
patient’s strength requires, with a few grains of salt
and a little sugar. Good apples roasted or boiled,
with other ripe fruits of an opening cooling nature,
may be eaten.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drink may be suited to the state of the patient’s
strength and spirits. If these be pretty high, the
drink ought to be weak; as water-gruel, balm-tea,
or the decoction mentioned below<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c010'><sup>[85]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient’s spirits are low, and the eruption
does not rise sufficiently, his drink must be a
little more generous; as wine-whey, or small negus,
sharpened with the juice of orange or lemon, and
made stronger or weaker as circumstances may
require.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the miliary fever approaches towards a
putrid nature, in which case the patient’s strength
must be supported with generous cordials, joined
with acids; and, if the degree of putrescence be
great, the Peruvian bark must be administered.
If the head be much affected, the body must be
kept open by emollient clysters<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c010'><sup>[86]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>MEDICINE.——If the food and drink be properly
regulated, there will be little occasion for medicine
in this disease. Should the eruption however
not rise, or the spirits flag, it will not only be necessary
to support the patient with cordials, but likewise
to apply blistering plasters. The most proper
cordial, in this case, is good wine, which may either
be taken in the patient’s food or drink; and if there
be signs of putrescence, the bark and acids may be
mixed with wine, as directed in the putrid fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some recommend blistering through the whole
course of this disease; and where Nature flags, and
the eruption comes and goes, it may be necessary
to keep up a stimulus, by a continual succession of
small blistering plasters; but we would not recommend
above one at a time. If however the pulse
should sink remarkably, the pustules fall in, and
the head be affected, it will be necessary to apply
several blistering plasters to the most sensible parts,
as the inside of the legs and thighs, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding is seldom necessary in this disease, and
sometimes it does much hurt, as it weakens the patient,
and depresses his spirits. It is therefore never
to be attempted unless by the advice of a physician.
We mention this, because it has been customary to
treat this disease in child-bed-women by plentiful
bleeding, and other evacuations, as if it were highly
inflammatory. But this practice is generally very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>unsafe. Patients in this situation bear evacuations
very ill. And indeed the disease seems often to be
more of a putrid than of an inflammatory nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though this fever is often occasioned in child-bed-women
by too hot a regimen, yet it would be
dangerous to leave that off all of a sudden, and have
recourse to a very cool regimen, and large evacuations.
We have reason to believe, that supporting
the patient’s spirits, and promoting the natural evacuations,
is here much safer than to have recourse
to artificial ones, as these, by sinking the spirits,
seldom fail to increase the danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disease proves tedious, or the recovery slow,
we would recommend the Peruvian bark, which may
either be taken in substance, or infused in wine or
water, as the patient inclines.</p>

<p class='c008'>The miliary fever, like other eruptive diseases,
requires gentle purging, which should not be neglected,
as soon as the fever is gone off, and the
patient’s strength will permit.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent this disease, a pure dry air, sufficient
exercise, and wholesome food, are necessary. Pregnant
women should guard against costiveness, and
take daily as much exercise as they can bear, avoiding
all green trashy fruits, and other unwholesome
things; and when in child-bed, they ought strictly
to observe a cool regimen.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE REMITTING FEVER.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This fever takes its name from a remission of
the symptoms, which happens sometimes sooner,
and sometimes later, but generally before the eighth
day. The remission is commonly preceded by a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>gentle sweat, after which the patient seems greatly
relieved, but in a few hours the fever returns. These
remissions return at very irregular periods, and are
sometimes of longer, sometimes of shorter duration;
the nearer however that the fever approaches to a
regular intermittent, the danger is the less.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——Remitting fevers prevail in low
marshy countries abounding with wood and stagnating
water; but they prove most fatal in places where
great heat and moisture are combined, as in some
parts of Africa, the province of Bengal in the East
Indies, &#38;c. where remitting fevers are generally of
a putrid kind, and prove very fatal. They are most
frequent in close calm weather, especially after
rainy seasons, great inundations, or the like. No
age, sex, or constitution, is exempted from the attack
of this fever; but it chiefly seizes persons of a
relaxed habit, who live in low dirty habitations,
breathe an impure stagnating air, take little exercise,
and use unwholesome diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The first symptoms of this
fever are generally yawning, stretching, pain, and
giddiness in the head, with alternate fits of heat
and cold. Sometimes the patient is affected with a
delirium at the very first attack. There is a pain,
and sometimes a swelling, about the region of the
stomach; the tongue is white, the eyes and skin frequently
appear yellow, and the patient is often
afflicted with bilious vomitings. The pulse is sometimes
a little hard, but seldom full, and the blood,
when let, rarely shews any signs of inflammation.
Some patients are exceedingly costive, and others
are afflicted with a very troublesome looseness.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to describe all the symptoms of
this disease, as they vary according to the situation,
the season of the year, and the constitution of the
patient. They may likewise be greatly changed by
the method of treatment, and by many other circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>too tedious to mention. Sometimes
the bilious symptoms predominate, sometimes the
nervous, and at other times the putrid. Nor is it
at all uncommon to find a succession of each of these,
or even a complication of them at the same time, in
the same person.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The regimen must be adapted
to the prevailing symptoms. When there are any
signs of inflammation, the diet must be slender, and
the drink weak and diluting. But when nervous or
putrid symptoms occur, it will be necessary to support
the patient with food and liquors of a more
generous nature, such as are recommended in the
immediately preceding fevers. We must however
be very cautious in the use of things of a heating
quality, as this fever is frequently changed into a
<i>continual</i> by an hot regimen, and improper medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever the symptoms are, the patient ought to
be kept cool, quiet, and clean. His apartment, if
possible, should be large, and frequently ventilated
by letting in fresh air at the doors or windows. It
ought likewise to be sprinkled with vinegar, juice of
lemon, or the like. His linen, bed-clothes, &#38;c.
should be frequently changed, and all his excrements
immediately removed. Though these things have
been recommended before, we think it necessary to
repeat them here, as they are of more importance to
the sick than practitioners are apt to imagine<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c010'><sup>[87]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>MEDICINE.——In order to cure this fever, we
must endeavour to bring it to a regular intermission.
This intention may be promoted by bleeding, if
there be any signs of inflammation; but when that
is not the case, bleeding ought by no means to be
attempted, as it will weaken the patient and prolong
the disease. A vomit however will seldom be
improper, and is generally of great service. Twenty
or thirty grains of ipecacuanha will answer this purpose
very well; but, where it can be obtained, we
would rather recommend a grain or two of tartar
emetic, with five or six grains of ipecacuanha, to be
made into a draught, and given for a vomit. This
may be repeated once or twice at proper intervals,
if the sickness or nausea continues.</p>

<p class='c008'>The body ought to be kept open either by clysters
or gentle laxatives, as weak infusions of senna and
manna, small doses of the lenitive electuary, cream
of tartar, tamarinds, stewed prunes, or the like;
but all strong or drastic purgatives are to be carefully
avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>By this course the fever in a few days may generally
be brought to a pretty regular or distinct intermission,
in which case the Peruvian bark may be
administered, and it will seldom fail to perfect the
cure. It is needless here to repeat the methods of
giving the bark, as we have already had occasion
frequently to mention them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most likely way to avoid this fever is to use
a wholesome and nourishing diet, to pay the most
scrupulous attention to cleanliness, to keep the body
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>warm, to take sufficient exercise, and in hot countries
to avoid damp situations, night air, evening
dews, and the like. In countries where it is endemical,
the best preventive medicine which we can
recommend, is the Peruvian bark, which may either
be chewed, or infused in brandy or wine, &#38;c.
Some recommend smoking tobacco as very beneficial
in marshy countries, both for the prevention of
this and intermitting fevers.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE SMALL-POX.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This disease, which originally came from
Arabia, is now become so general, that very
few escape it at one time of life or another. It is a
most contagious malady; and has for many years
proved the scourge of Europe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small-pox generally appear towards the
spring. They are very frequent in summer, less so
in autumn, and least of all in winter. Children are
most liable to this disease; and those whose food is
unwholesome, who want proper exercise, and
abound with gross humours, run the greatest hazard
from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The disease is distinguished into the distinct and
confluent kind; the latter of which is always attended
with danger. There are likewise other
distinctions of the small-pox; as the crystalline, the
bloody, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The small-pox is commonly caught
by infection. Since the disease was first brought
into Europe, the infection has never been wholly
extinguished, nor have any proper methods, as far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>as I know, been taken for that purpose; so that
now it has become in a manner constitutional.
Children who have overheated themselves by running,
wrestling, &#38;c. or adults after a debauch,
are most apt to be seized with the small-pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——This disease is so generally
known, that a minute description of it is unnecessary.
Children commonly look a little dull,
seem lifeless and drowsy for a few days before the
more violent symptoms of the small-pox appear.
They are likewise more inclined to drink than usual,
have little appetite for solid food, complain of
weariness, and, upon taking exercise, are apt to
sweat. These are succeeded by slight fits of cold
and heat in turns, which, as the time of the eruption
approaches, become more violent, and are accompanied
with pains of the head and loins, vomiting,
&#38;c. The pulse is quick, with a great
heat of the skin, and restlessness. When the patient
drops asleep, he wakes in a kind of horror,
with a sudden start, which is a very common symptom
of the approaching eruption; as are also convulsion-fits
in very young children.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the third or fourth day from the time of
sickening, the small-pox generally begin to appear;
sometimes indeed they appear sooner, but that is no
favourable symptom. At first they very nearly resemble
flea-bites, and are soonest discovered on the
face, arms, and breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most favourable symptoms are a slow eruption,
and an abatement of the fever as soon as the
pustules appear. In a mild distinct kind of small-pox
the pustules seldom appear before the fourth
day from the time of sickening, and they generally
keep coming out gradually for several days after.
Pustules which are distinct, with a florid red basis,
and which fill with thick purulent matter, first of a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>whitish, and afterwards of a yellowish colour, are
the best.</p>

<p class='c008'>A livid brown colour of the pustules is an unfavourable
symptom; as also when they are small
and flat, with black specks in the middle. Pustules
which contain a thin watery ichor are very bad. A
great number of pox on the face is always attended
with danger. It is likewise a very bad sign when
they run into one another.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a most unfavourable symptom when petechiæ,
or purple, brown, or black spots are interspersed
among the pustules. These are signs of a putrid
dissolution of the blood, and shew the danger to
be very great. Bloody stools or urine, with a
swelled belly, are bad symptoms; as is also a continual
strangury. Pale urine and a violent throbbing
of the arteries of the neck are signs of an approaching
delirium, or of convulsion-fits. When
the face does not swell, or falls before the pox come
to maturity, it is very unfavourable. If the face
begins to fall about the eleventh or twelfth day, and
at the same time the hands and feet begin to swell,
the patient generally does well; but when these do
not succeed to each other, there is reason to apprehend
danger. When the tongue is covered with a
brown crust, it is an unfavourable symptom. Cold
shivering fits coming on at the height of the disease
are likewise unfavourable. Grinding of the
teeth, when it proceeds from an affection of the
nervous system, is a bad sign; but sometimes it
is occasioned by worms, or a disordered stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——When the first symptoms of the
small-pox appear, people are ready to be alarmed,
and often fly to the use of medicine, to the great
danger of the patient’s life. I have known children,
to appease the anxiety of their parents, bled,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>blistered, and purged, during the fever which preceded
the eruption of the small-pox, to such a degree,
that Nature was not only disturbed in her
operation, but rendered unable to support the
pustules after they were out; so that the patient,
exhausted by mere evacuations, sunk under the
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>When convulsions appear, they give a dreadful
alarm. Immediately some nostrum is applied, as
if this were a primary disease; whereas it is only a
symptom, and far from being an unfavourable one,
of the approaching eruption. As the fits generally
go off before the actual appearance of the small-pox,
it is attributed to the medicine, which by
this means acquires a reputation without any
merit<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c010'><sup>[88]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>All that is, generally speaking, necessary during
the eruptive fever, is to keep the patient cool and
easy, allowing him to drink freely of some weak
diluting liquors; as balm-tea, barley-water, clear
whey, gruels, &#38;c. He should not be confined to
bed, but should sit up as much as he is able, and
should have his feet and legs frequently bathed in
lukewarm water. His food ought to be very light;
and he should be as little disturbed with company
as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much mischief is done at this period by confining
the patient too soon to his bed, and plying him with
warm cordials or sudorific medicines. Every thing
that heats and inflames the blood increases the fever,
and pushes out the pustules prematurely. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>has numberless ill effects. It not only increases the
number of pustules, but likewise tends to make
them run into one another; and when they have
been pushed out with too great violence, they generally
fall in before they come to maturity.</p>

<p class='c008'>The good women, as soon as they see the small-pox
begin to appear, commonly ply their tender
charge with cordials, saffron, and marigold-teas,
wine, punch, and even brandy itself. All these
are given with a view, as they term it, to throw out
the eruption from the heart. This, like most other
popular mistakes, is the abuse of a very just observation,
<i>that when there is a moisture on the skin,
the pox rise better, and the patient is easier, than when
it continues dry and parched</i>. But that is no reason
for forcing the patient into a sweat. Sweating
never relieves unless where it comes spontaneously,
or is the effect of drinking weak diluting liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children are often so peevish, that they will not
lie a-bed without a nurse constantly by them. Indulging
them in this, we have reason to believe,
has many bad effects both upon the nurse and child.
Even the natural heat of the nurse cannot fail to
augment the fever of the child, but if she too
proves feverish, which is often the case, the danger
must be increased<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c010'><sup>[89]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Laying several children who have the small-pox
in the same bed has many ill consequences. They
ought if possible never to be in the same chamber,
as the perspiration, the heat, the smell, &#38;c. all
tend to augment the fever, and to heighten the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>disease. It is common among the poor to see two
or three children lying in the same bed, with such
a load of pustules that even their skins stick together.
One can hardly view a scene of this kind
without being sickened by the sight. But how must
the effluvia affect the poor patients, many of whom
perish by this usage<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c010'><sup>[90]</sup></a>!</p>

<p class='c008'>A very dirty custom prevails among the lower
class of people, of allowing children in the small-pox
to keep on the same linen during the whole period
of that loathsome disease. This is done lest
they should catch cold; but it has many ill consequences.
The linen becomes hard by the moisture
which it absorbs, and frets the tender skin. It
likewise occasions a bad smell, which is very pernicious
both to the patient and those about him; besides,
the filth and sordes which adhere to the linen
being resorbed, or taken up again into the body,
greatly augment the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>A patient should not be suffered to be dirty in
an internal disease, far less in the small-pox. Cutaneous
disorders are often occasioned by nastiness
alone, and are always increased by it. Were the
patient’s linen to be changed every day, it would
greatly refresh him. Care indeed is to be taken
that the linen be thoroughly dry. It ought likewise
to be put on when the patient is most
cool.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>So strong is the vulgar prejudice in this country,
notwithstanding all that has been said against the
hot regimen in the small-pox, that numbers still
fall a sacrifice to that error. I have seen poor
women travelling in the depth of winter, and carrying
their children along with them in the small-pox,
and have frequently observed others begging
by the way-side, with infants in their arms covered
with the pustules; yet I could never learn that one
of these children died by this sort of treatment.
This is certainly a sufficient proof of the safety at
least, of exposing patients in the small-pox to the
open air. There can be no reason however for exposing
them to public view. It is now very common
in the environs of great towns to meet patients
in the small-pox on the public walks. This practice,
however well it may suit the purposes of
boasting inoculators, is dangerous to the citizens,
and contrary to the laws of humanity and sound
policy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The food in this disease ought to be very light,
and of a cooling nature, as panado, or bread
boiled with equal quantities of milk and water,
good apples roasted or boiled with milk, and sweetened
with a little sugar, or such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drink may be equal parts of milk and water,
clear sweet whey, barley-water, or thin gruel, &#38;c.
After the pox are full, butter-milk, being of an
opening and cleansing nature, is a very proper
drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——This disease is generally divided
into four different periods, <i>viz.</i> the fever
which precedes the eruption, the eruption itself, the
suppuration, or maturation of the pustules, and the
secondary fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has already been observed, that little more is
necessary during the primary fever than to keep the
patient cool and quiet, allowing him to drink diluting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>liquors, and bathing his feet frequently in
warm water. Though this be generally the safest
course that can be taken with infants, yet adults of
a strong constitution and plethoric habit sometimes
require bleeding. When a full pulse, a dry skin,
and other symptoms of inflammation render this
operation necessary, it ought to be performed; but,
unless these symptoms are urgent, it is safer to let it
alone; if the body is bound, emollient clysters may
be thrown in.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there is a great nausea or inclination to vomit,
weak camomile-tea or lukewarm water may be
drank, in order to clean the stomach. At the beginning
of a fever, Nature generally attempts a
discharge, either upwards or downwards, which, if
promoted by gentle means, would tend greatly to
abate the violence of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though every method is to be taken during the
primary fever, by a cool regimen, &#38;c. to prevent
too great an eruption; yet after the pustules have
made their appearance, our business is to promote
the suppuration, by diluting drink, light food, and,
if Nature seems to flag, by generous cordials.
When a low, creeping pulse, faintishness, and great
loss of strength, render cordials necessary, we would
recommend good wine, which may be made into
negus, with an equal quantity of water, and sharpened
with the juice of orange, the jelly of currants,
or the like. Wine-whey, sharpened as
above, is likewise a proper drink in this case;
great care however must be taken not to overheat
the patient by any of these things. This,
instead of promoting, would retard the eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rising of the small-pox is often prevented
by the violence of the fever; in this case the cool
regimen is strictly to be observed. The patient’s
chamber must not only be kept cool, but he ought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>likewise frequently to be taken out of bed, and to
be lightly covered with clothes while in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Excessive restlessness often prevents the rising and
filling of the small-pox. When this happens,
gentle opiates are necessary. These however ought
always to be administered with a sparing hand. To
an infant, a tea-spoonful of the syrup of poppies may
be given every five or six hours till it has the desired
effect. An adult will require a table-spoonful in
order to answer the same purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be troubled with a strangury, or
suppression of urine, which often happens in the
small-pox, he should be frequently taken out of
bed, and, if he be able, should walk across the
room with his feet bare. When he cannot do this,
he may be frequently set on his knees in bed, and
should endeavour to pass his urine as often as he
can. When these do not succeed, a tea-spoonful of
the sweet spirits of nitre may be occasionally mixed
with his drink. Nothing more certainly relieves
the patient, or is more beneficial in the small-pox,
than a plentiful discharge of urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the mouth be foul, and the tongue dry and
chapped, it ought to be frequently washed, and the
throat gargled with water and honey, sharpened with
a little vinegar or currant jelly.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the rising of the small-pox, it frequently
happens that the patient is eight or ten days without
a stool. This not only tends to heat and inflame
the blood, but the fæces, by lodging so long
in the body, become acrid, and even putrid; from
whence bad consequences must ensue. It will
therefore be proper, when the body is bound, to
throw in an emollient clyster every second or third
day, through the whole course of the disease. This
will greatly cool and relieve the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>When petechiæ, or purple, black, or livid spots
appear among the small-pox, the Peruvian bark
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>must immediately be administered in as large doses
as the patient’s stomach can bear. For a child, two
drachms of the bark in powder may be mixed in
three ounces of common water, one ounce of simple
cinnamon-water, and two ounces of the syrup of
orange or lemon. This may be sharpened with the
spirits of vitriol, and a table-spoonful of it given
every hour. If it be given to an adult in the same
form, he may take at least three or four spoonfuls
every hour. This medicine ought not to be trifled
with, but must be administered as frequently as
the stomach can bear it; in which case it will often
produce very happy effects. I have frequently seen
the petechiæ disappear, and the small-pox, which
had a very threatening aspect, rise and fill with
laudable matter, by the use of the bark and
acids.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s drink ought likewise in this case
to be generous, as wine or strong negus acidulated
with spirits of vitriol, vinegar, the juice of lemon,
jelly of currants, or such like. His food must
consist of apples roasted or boiled, preserved
cherries, plums, and other fruits of an acid
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bark and acids are not only necessary when
the petechiæ or putrid symptoms appear, but likewise
in the lymphatic or crystalline small-pox,
where the matter is thin, and not duly prepared.
The Peruvian bark seems to possess a singular
power of assisting Nature in preparing laudable
pus, or what is called good matter; consequently
it must be beneficial both in this and other diseases,
where the crisis depends on a suppuration. I have
often observed where the small-pox were flat, and
the matter contained in them quite clear and transparent,
and where at first they had the appearance
of running into one another, that the Peruvian bark,
acidulated as above, changed the colour and consistence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of the matter, and produced the most happy
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the eruption subsides suddenly, or, as the
good women term it, when the small-pox <i>strike in</i>,
before they have arrived at maturity, the danger is
very great. In this case blistering-plasters must be
immediately applied to the wrists and ancles, and
the patient’s spirits supported with cordials.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes bleeding has a surprising effect in
raising the pustules after they have subsided; but it
requires skill to know when this is proper, or to
what length the patient can bear it. Sharp cataplasms
however may be applied to the feet and
hands, as they tend to promote the swelling of these
parts, and by that means to draw the humours towards
the extremities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most dangerous period of this disease is
what we call the secondary fever. This generally
comes on when the small-pox begin to blacken, or
turn on the face; and most of those who die of the
small-pox are carried off by this fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nature generally attempts, at the turn of the
small-pox, to relieve the patient by loose stools.
Her endeavours this way are by no means to be
counteracted, but promoted, and the patient at the
same time supported by food and drink of a nourishing
and cordial nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, at the approach of the secondary fever, the
pulse be very quick, hard, and strong, the heat
intense, and the breathing laborious, with other
symptoms of an inflammation of the breast, the
patient must immediately be bled. The quantity of
blood to be let must be regulated by the patient’s
strength, age, and the urgency of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>But, in the secondary fever, if the patient be
faintish, the pustules become suddenly pale, and
if there be great coldness of the extremities, blistering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>plasters must be applied, and the patient must
be supported with generous cordials. Wine and
even spirits have sometimes been given in such cases
with amazing success.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the secondary fever is in great measure, if not
wholly, owing to the absorption of the matter, it
would seem highly consonant to reason, that the
pustules, as soon as they come to maturity, should
be opened. This is every day practiced in other
phlegmons which tend to suppuration; and there
seems to be no cause why it should be less proper
here. On the contrary, we have reason to believe,
that by this means the secondary fever might always
be lessened, and often wholly prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>The pustules should be opened when they begin
to turn of a yellow colour. Very little art is necessary
for this operation. They may either be
opened with a lancet or a needle, and the matter
absorbed by a little dry lint. As the pustules are
generally first ripe on the face, it will be proper to
begin with opening these, and the others in course
as they become ripe. The pustules generally fill
again, a second or even a third time; for which
cause the operation must be repeated, or rather
continued as long as there is any considerable appearance
of matter in the pustules.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have reason to believe that this operation,
rational as it is, has been neglected from a piece
of mistaken tenderness in parents. They believe
that it must give great pain to the poor child; and
therefore would rather see it die than have it thus
tortured. This notion however is entirely without
foundation. I have frequently opened the pustules
when the patient did not see me, without his being
in the least sensible of it; but suppose it were attended
with a little pain, that is nothing in comparison
to the advantages which arise from it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Opening the pustules not only prevents the resorption
of the matter into the blood, but likewise
takes off the tension of the skin, and by that
means greatly relieves the patient. It likewise
tends to prevent the pitting, which is a matter of
no small importance. Acrid matter, by lodging
long in the pustules, cannot fail to corrode the
tender skin; by which many a handsome face becomes
so deformed as hardly to bear a resemblance
to the human figure<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c010'><sup>[91]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally necessary, after the small-pox are
gone off, to purge the patient. If however the
body has been open through the whole course of
the disease, or if butter-milk and other things of
an opening nature have been drank freely after
the height of the small-pox, purging becomes
less necessary; but it ought never wholly to be
neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>For very young children, an infusion of senna
and prunes, with a little rhubarb, may be sweetened
with coarse sugar, and given in small quantities
till it operates. Those who are farther advanced
must take medicines of a sharper nature. For example,
a child of five or six years of age may take
eight or ten grains of fine rhubarb in powder over
night, and the same quantity of jalap in powder
next morning. This may be wrought off with
fresh broth or water-gruel, and may be repeated
three or four times, five or six days intervening between
each dose. For children further advanced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>and adults, the dose must be increased in proportion
to the age and constitution<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c010'><sup>[92]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When imposthumes happen after the small-pox,
which is not seldom the case, they must be brought
to suppuration as soon as possible, by means of ripening
poultices; and when they have been opened,
or have broke of their own accord, the patient must
be purged. The Peruvian bark and a milk diet
will likewise be useful in this case.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a cough, a difficulty of breathing, or other
symptoms of a consumption, succeed to the small-pox,
the patient must be sent to a place where the
air is good, and put upon a course of asses milk,
with such exercise as he can bear. For further directions
in this case, see the article <i>Consumptions</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF INOCULATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though no disease, after it is formed, baffles the
powers of medicine more effectually than the small-pox,
yet more may be done before-hand to render
this disease favourable than any one we know, as
almost all the danger from it may be prevented by
inoculation. This salutary invention has been
known in Europe above half a century; but, like
most other useful discoveries, it has till of late
made but slow progress. It must however be acknowledged,
to the honour of this country, that
inoculation has met with a more favourable reception
here, than among any of our neighbours. It
is still however far from being general, which we
have reason to fear will be the case, as long as the
practice continues in the hands of the faculty.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>No discovery can be of general utility, while the
practice of it is kept in the hands of a few. Had
the inoculation of the small-pox been introduced as
a fashion, and not as a medical discovery, or had it
been practiced by the same kind of operators here, as
it is in those countries from whence we learned it, it
had long ago been universal. The fears, the jealousies,
the prejudices, and the opposite interests of
the faculty, are, and ever will be, the most effectual
obstacles to the progress of any salutary discovery.
Hence it is that the practice of inoculation never became
in any measure general, even in England, till
taken up by men not bred to physic. These have
not only rendered the practice more extensive, but
likewise more safe, and by acting under less restraint
than the regular practitioners, have taught
them that the patient’s greatest danger arose, not
from the want of care, but from the excess of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>They know very little of the matter, who impute
the success of modern inoculators to any superior
skill, either in preparing the patient or communicating
the disease. Some of them indeed, from a sordid
desire of engrossing the whole practice to themselves,
pretend to have extraordinary secrets or nostrums for
preparing persons for inoculation, which never fail
of success. But this is only a pretence calculated to
blind the ignorant and inattentive. Common sense
and prudence alone are sufficient both in the choice
of the subject and management of the operation.
Whoever is possessed of these may perform this
office for his children whenever he finds it convenient,
provided they be in a good state of health.</p>

<p class='c008'>This sentiment is not the result of theory, but of
observation. Though few physicians have had more
opportunities of trying inoculation in all its different
forms, so little appears to me to depend on those,
generally reckoned important circumstances, of preparing
the body, communicating the infection by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>this or the other method, &#38;c. that for several years
past I have persuaded the parents or nurses to perform
the whole themselves, and have found that
method followed with equal success, while it is free
from many inconveniences that attend the other<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c010'><sup>[93]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The small-pox may be communicated in a great
variety of ways with nearly the same degree of safety
and success. In Turkey, from whence we learned
the practice, the women communicate the disease to
children, by opening a bit of the skin with a needle,
and putting into the wound a little matter taken
from a ripe pustule. On the coast of Barbary they
pass a thread wet with the matter through the skin
between the thumb and fore-finger; and in some of
the states of Barbary, inoculation is performed by
rubbing in the variolous matter between the thumb
and fore-finger, or on other parts of the body.
The practice of communicating the small-pox, by
rubbing the variolous matter upon the skin, has
been long known in many parts of Asia and Europe,
as well as in Barbary, and has generally gone by the
name of <i>buying the small-pox</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>The present method of inoculating in Britain is to
make two or three slanting incisions in the arm, so
superficial as not to pierce quite through the skin,
with a lancet wet with fresh matter taken from a ripe
pustule; afterwards the wounds are closed up, and
left without any dressing. Some make use of a lancet
covered with the dry matter; but this is less certain,
and ought never to be used unless where fresh
matter cannot be obtained: when this is the case,
the matter ought to be moistened by holding the
lancet for some time in the steam of warm water<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c010'><sup>[94]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, if fresh matter be applied long enough
to the skin, there is no occasion for any wound at
all. Let a bit of thread, about half an inch long,
wet with the matter, be immediately applied to the
arm, midway between the shoulder and the elbow,
and covered with a piece of the common sticking-plaster,
and kept on for eight or ten days. This
will seldom fail to communicate the disease. We
mention this method, because many people are
afraid of a wound; and doubtless the more easily the
operation can be performed, it has the greater
chance to become general. Some people imagine,
that the discharge from a wound lessens the eruption;
but there is no great stress to be laid upon
this notion; besides, deep wounds often ulcerate,
and become troublesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>We do not find that inoculation is at all considered
as a medical operation in those countries from whence
we learned it. In Turkey it is performed by the
women, and in the East Indies by the Brachmins or
priests. In this country the custom is still in its
infancy; we make no doubt, however, but it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>soon become so familiar, that parents will think no
more of inoculating their children, than at present
they do of giving them a purge.</p>

<p class='c008'>No set of men have it so much in their power to
render the practice of inoculation general as the
clergy, the greatest opposition to it still arising from
some scruples of conscience, which they alone can
remove. I would recommend it to them not only
to endeavour to remove the religious objections
which weak minds may have to this salutary practice,
but to enjoin it as a duty, and to point out the danger
of neglecting to make use of a mean which Providence
has put in our power for saving the lives of
our offspring. Surely such parents as wilfully neglect
the means of saving their children’s lives, are
as guilty as those who put them to death. I wish
this matter were duly weighed. No one is more
ready to make allowance for human weakness and
religious prejudices, yet I cannot help recommending
it, in the warmest manner, to parents, to consider
how great an injury they do their children, by
neglecting to give them this disease in the early
period of life.</p>

<p class='c008'>The numerous advantages arising from the inoculation
of the small-pox have been pretty fully
pointed out by the learned Dr. M‘Kenzie, in his
History of Health<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c010'><sup>[95]</sup></a>. To those mentioned by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>Doctor we shall only add, that such as have not had
the small-pox in the early period of life, are not
only rendered unhappy, but likewise in a great
measure unfit for sustaining many of the most useful
and important offices. Few people would chuse
even to hire a servant who had not had the small-pox,
far less to purchase a slave who had the chance
of dying of this disease. How could a physician or
a surgeon, who had never had the small-pox himself,
attend others under that malady? How deplorable
is the situation of females, who arrive at mature age
without having had the small-pox! A woman with
child seldom survives this disease: and if an infant
happen to be seized with the small-pox upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>mother’s breast, who has not had the disease herself
the scene must be distressing! If she continue to
suckle the child, it is at the peril of her own life;
and if she wean it, in all probability it will perish.
How often is the affectionate mother forced to leave
her house, and abandon her children, at the very
time when her care is most necessary? Yet should
parental affection get the better of her fears, the
consequences would often prove fatal. I have
known the tender mother and her sucking infant
laid in the same grave, both untimely victims to
this dreadful malady. But these are scenes too
shocking even to mention. Let parents who run
away with their children to avoid the small-pox, or
who refuse to inoculate them in infancy, consider to
what deplorable situations, they may be reduced by
this mistaken tenderness!</p>

<p class='c008'>As the small-pox is now become an epidemical
disease in most parts of the known world, no other
choice remains but to render the malady as mild as
possible. This is the only manner of extirpation
now left in our power; and though it may seem
paradoxical, the artificial method of communicating
the disease, could it be rendered universal,
would amount to nearly the same thing as rooting
it out. It is a matter of small consequence, whether
a disease be entirely extirpated, or rendered so mild
as neither to destroy life nor hurt the constitution;
but that this may be done by inoculation, does not
now admit of a doubt. The numbers who die under
inoculation hardly deserve to be named. In the
natural way, one in four or five generally dies; but
by inoculation not one of a thousand. Nay, some
can boast of having inoculated ten thousand without
the loss of a single patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have often wished to see some plan established
for rendering this salutary practice universal; but
am afraid I shall never be so happy. The difficulties
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>indeed are many; yet the thing is by no
means impracticable. The aim is great; no less
than saving the lives of one-fourth part of mankind.
What ought not to be attempted in order
to accomplish so desirable an end?</p>

<p class='c008'>The first step towards rendering the practice universal,
must be to remove the religious prejudices
against it. This, as already observed, can only be
done by the clergy. They must not only recommend
it as a duty to others, but likewise practise
it on their own children. Example will ever have
more influence than precept.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next thing requisite is to put it in the power
of all. For this purpose we would recommend it to
the Faculty to inoculate the children of the poor
<i>gratis</i>. It is hard that so useful a part of mankind
should by their poverty be excluded from such
a benefit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should this fail, it is surely in the power of any
State to render the practice general, at least as far
as their dominion extends. We do not mean that it
ought to be enforced by a law. The best way to
promote it would be to employ a sufficient number
of operators at the public expence to inoculate the
children of the poor. This would only be necessary
till the practice became general; afterwards
custom, the strongest of all laws, would oblige
every individual to inoculate his children to prevent
reflections.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be objected to this scheme, that the poor
would refuse to employ the inoculators: this difficulty
is easily removed. A small premium to enable
mothers to attend their children while under
the disease, would be a sufficient inducement; besides,
the success attending the operation would soon
banish all objections to it. Even considerations of
profit would induce the poor to embrace this plan.
They often bring up their children to the age of ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>or twelve, and when they come to be useful, they
are snatched away by this malady, to the great loss
of their parents, and detriment of the public.</p>

<p class='c008'>The British legislature has of late years shewn
great attention to the preservation of infant lives,
by supporting the foundling hospital, &#38;c. But we
will venture to say, if one-tenth part of the sums
laid out in supporting that institution, had been
bestowed towards promoting the practice of inoculation
of the small-pox among the poor, that not
only more useful lives had been saved, but the
practice ere now rendered quite universal in this
island. It is not to be imagined what effect example
and a little money will have upon the poor;
yet, if left to themselves, they would go on for
ever in the old way, without thinking of any improvement.
We only mean this as a hint to the
humane and public-spirited. Should such a scheme
be approved, a proper plan might easily be laid
down for the execution of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But as public plans are very difficult to bring
about, and often, by the selfish views and misconduct
of those intrusted with the execution of them,
fail of answering the noble purposes for which they
were designed; we shall therefore point out some
other method by which the benefits of inoculation
may be extended to the poor.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no doubt but inoculators will daily become
more numerous. We would therefore have
every parish in Britain to allow one of them a small
annual salary for inoculating all the children of the
parish at a proper age. This might be done at a
very trifling expence, and it would enable every
one to enjoy the benefit of this salutary invention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Two things chiefly operate to prevent the progress
of inoculation. The one is a wish to put the
evil day as far off as possible. This is a principle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>in our nature; and as inoculation seems rather to
be anticipating a future evil, it is no wonder mankind
are so averse to it. But this objection is sufficiently
answered by the success. Who in his senses
would not prefer a lesser evil to-day to a greater
to-morrow, provided they were equally certain?</p>

<p class='c008'>The other obstacle is the fear of reflections.
This has very great weight with the bulk of mankind.
Should the child die, they think the world
would blame them. This they cannot bear. Here
lies the difficulty; and till that be removed, inoculation
will make but small progress. Nothing
however can remove it but custom. Make the
practice fashionable, and all objections will soon
vanish. It is fashion alone that has led the multitude
since the beginning of the world, and will
lead them to the end. We must therefore call upon
the more enlightened part of mankind to set a pattern
to the rest. Their example, though it may for
some time meet with opposition, will at length
prevail.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am aware of an objection to this practice from
the expence with which it may be attended: this
is easily obviated. We do not mean that every
parish ought to employ a Sutton or a Dimsdale as
inoculators. These have by their success already
recommended themselves to crowned heads, and
are beyond the vulgar reach; but have not others
an equal chance to succeed? They certainly have.
Let them make the same trial, and the difficulties
will soon vanish. There is not a parish, and hardly
a village in Britain, destitute of some person who
can bleed. But this is a far more difficult operation,
and requires both more skill and dexterity
than inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>The persons to whom we would chiefly recommend
the performance of this operation are the
clergy. Most of them know something of medicine.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Almost all of them bleed, and can order a
purge, which are all the qualifications necessary
for the practice of inoculation. The priests among
the less enlightened Indians perform this office, and
why should a Christian teacher think himself above
it? Surely the bodies of men, as well as their souls,
merit a part of the pastor’s care; at lead the greatest
Teacher who ever appeared among men seems to
have thought so.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should all other methods fail, we would recommend
it to parents to perform the operation themselves.
Let them take any method of communicating
the disease they please; provided the subjects
be healthy, and of a proper age, they will
seldom fail to succeed to their wish. I have known
many instances even of mothers performing the
operation, and never so much as heard of one bad
consequence. A planter in one of the West India
islands is said to have inoculated, with his own
hand, in one year, three hundred of his slaves,
who, notwithstanding the warmth of the climate,
and other unfavourable circumstances, all did well.
Common mechanics have often, to my knowledge,
performed the operation with as good success
as physicians. We do not however mean to
discourage those who have it in their power, from
employing people of skill to inoculate their children,
and attend them while under the disease,
but only to shew, that where such cannot be had,
the operation ought not upon that account to be
neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of multiplying arguments to recommend
this practice, I shall just beg leave to mention the
method which I took with my own son, then an
only child. After giving him two gentle purges,
I ordered the nurse to take a bit of thread which
had been previously wet with fresh matter from a
pock, and to lay it upon his arm, covering it with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>a piece of sticking-plaster. This remained on six or
seven days, till it was rubbed off by accident. At
the usual time the small-pox made their appearance,
and were exceedingly favourable. Surely
this, which is all that is generally necessary, may
be done without any skill in medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have been the more full upon this subject because
the benefits of inoculation cannot be extended
to society by any other means than making the
practice general. While it is confined to a few, it
must prove hurtful to the whole. By means of it
the contagion is spread, and is communicated to
many who might otherwise never have had the disease.
Accordingly it is found that more die of the
small-pox now than before inoculation was introduced;
and this important discovery, by which
alone more lives might be saved than by all the endeavours
of the Faculty, is in a great measure lost
by its benefits not being extended to the whole
community<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c010'><sup>[96]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The spring and autumn have been usually
reckoned the most proper seasons for inoculation,
on account of the weather being then most temperate;
but it ought to be considered that these are
generally the most unhealthy seasons of the whole
year. Undoubtedly the best preparation for the
disease is a previous good state of health. I have
always observed that children in particular are more
sickly towards the end of spring and autumn than
at any other time of the year. On this account, as
well as for the advantage of cool air, I would propose
winter as the most proper season for inoculation;
though, on every other consideration, the
spring would seem to be preferable.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>The most proper age for inoculation is between
three and five. Many approve of inoculating on
the breast, and where no circumstances forbid this
practice, I have no objection to it. Children,
however, are more liable to convulsions at this
time than afterwards; besides, the anxiety of the
mother or nurse, should the child be in danger,
would not fail to heighten it by spoiling the milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children who have constitutional diseases must
nevertheless be inoculated. It will often mend
the habit of body; but ought to be performed at
a time when they are most healthy. Accidental
diseases should always be removed before inoculation.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally thought necessary to regulate the
diet for some time before the disease be communicated.
In children, however, great alteration
in diet is seldom necessary, their food being commonly
of the most simple and wholesome kind, as
milk, water-pap, weak broths, bread, light pudding,
mild roots, and white meats.</p>

<p class='c008'>But children who have been accustomed to a
hotter diet, who are of a gross habit, or abound
with bad humours, ought to be put upon a spare
diet before they are inoculated. Their food should
be of a light cooling nature, and their drink whey,
butter-milk, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would recommend no other medicinal preparation
but two or three mild purges, which ought
to be suited to the age and strength of the patient.
The success of inoculators does not depend on the
preparation of their patients, but on their management
of them while under the disease. Their constant
care is to keep them cool, and their bodies
gently open, by which means the fever is kept
low, and the eruption greatly lessened. The danger
is seldom great when the pustules are few; and
their number is generally in proportion to the fever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>which precedes and attends the eruption. Hence
the chief secret of inoculation consists in regulating
the eruptive fever, which generally may be kept
sufficiently low by the methods mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c008'>The regimen during the disease is in all respects
the same as under the natural small-pox. The patient
must be kept cool, his diet should be light,
and his drink weak and diluting, &#38;c. Should any
bad symptoms appear, which is seldom the case,
they must be treated in the same way as directed in
the natural small-pox. Purging is not less necessary
after the small-pox by inoculation than in
the natural way, and ought by no means to be neglected.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXIV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE MEASLES.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The measles appeared in Europe about the same
time with the small-pox, and have a great
affinity to that disease. They both came from the
same quarter of the world, are both infectious,
and seldom attack the same person more than once.
The measles are most common in the spring season,
and generally disappear in summer. The disease
itself, when properly managed, seldom proves fatal;
but its consequences are often very troublesome.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSE.——This disease, like the small-pox,
proceeds from infection, and is more or less dangerous
according to the constitution of the patient,
the season of the year, the climate, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The measles, like other fevers,
are preceded by alternate fits of heat and
cold, with sickness, and loss of appetite. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>tongue is white, but generally moist. There is a
short cough, a heaviness of the head and eyes,
drowsiness, and a running at the nose. Sometimes
indeed the cough does not come before the
eruption has appeared. There is an inflammation
and heat in the eyes, accompanied with a defluxion
of sharp rheum, and great acuteness of sensation,
so that they cannot bear the light without pain.
The eye-lids frequently swell so as to occasion
blindness. The patient generally complains of his
throat; and a vomiting or looseness often precedes
the eruption. The stools in children are commonly
greenish; they complain of an itching of the skin,
and are remarkably peevish. Bleeding at the nose
is common, both before and in the progress of the
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the fourth day, small spots, resembling
flea-bites, appear, first upon the face; then upon
the breast, and afterwards on the extremities: these
may be distinguished from the small pox by their
scarcely rising above the skin. The fever, cough,
and difficulty of breathing, instead of being removed
by the eruption as in the small pox, are
rather increased; but the vomiting generally ceases.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the sixth or seventh day from the time of
sickening, the measles begin to turn pale on the
face, and afterwards upon the body; so that by the
ninth day they entirely disappear. The fever; however,
and difficulty of breathing, often continue,
especially if the patient has been kept upon too hot
a regimen. Petechiæ, or purple spots, may likewise
be occasioned by this error.</p>

<p class='c008'>A violent looseness sometimes succeeds the
measles; in which case the patient’s life is in imminent
danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as die of the measles generally expire about
the ninth day from the invasion, and are commonly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>carried off by a peripneumony, or inflammation of
the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most favourable symptoms are a moderate
looseness, a moist skin, and a plentiful discharge of
urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the eruption suddenly falls in, and the
patient is seized with a delirium, he is in the greatest
danger. If the measles turn too soon of a pale colour,
it is an unfavourable symptom, as are also
great weakness, vomiting, restlessness, and difficulty
of swallowing. Purple or black spots appearing
among the measles are very unfavourable. When
a continual cough, with hoarseness, succeeds the
disease, there is reason to suspect an approaching
consumption of the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our business in this disease is to assist Nature, by
proper cordials, in throwing out the eruption, if
her efforts be too languid; but when they are too
violent they must be restrained by evacuations, and
cool diluting liquors, &#38;c. We ought likewise to
endeavour to appease the most urgent symptoms,
as the cough, restlessness, and difficulty of breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The cool regimen is necessary
here as well as in the small-pox. The food too must
be light, and the drink diluting. Acids however
do not answer so well in the measles as in the
small-pox, as they tend to exasperate the cough.
Small beer likewise, though a good drink in the
small-pox, is here improper. The most suitable
liquors are decoctions of liquorice with marsh-mallow
roots and sarsaparilla, infusions of linseed,
or of the flowers of elder, balm-tea, clarified whey,
barley-water, and such like. These, if the patient
be costive, may be sweetened with honey; or,
if that should disagree with the stomach, a little
manna may occasionally be added to them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>MEDICINE.——The measles being an inflammatory
disease, without any critical discharge of
matter, as in the small-pox, bleeding is commonly
necessary, especially when the fever runs high, with
difficulty of breathing, and great oppression of the
breast. But if the disease be of a mild kind, bleeding
may be omitted<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c010'><sup>[97]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bathing the feet and legs frequently in lukewarm
water both tends to abate the violence of the fever,
and to promote the eruption.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient is often greatly relieved by vomiting.
When there is a tendency this way, it ought
to be promoted by drinking lukewarm water, or
weak camomile-tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the cough is very troublesome, with dryness
of the throat, and difficulty of breathing, the
patient may hold his head over the steam of warm
water, and draw the steam into his lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>He may likewise lick a little sperma-ceti and
sugar-candy pounded together; or take now and
then a spoonful of the oil of sweet almonds, with
sugar-candy dissolved in it. These will soften the
throat, and relieve the tickling cough.</p>

<p class='c008'>If at the turn of the disease the fever assumes
new vigour, and there appears great danger of
suffocation, the patient must be bled according to
his strength, and blistering-plasters applied, with
a view to prevent the load from being thrown on
the lungs, where if an inflammation should fix itself,
the patient’s life will be in imminent danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case the measles should suddenly disappear, it
will be necessary to pursue the same method which
we have recommended when the small-pox recede.
The patient must be supported with wine and cordials.
Blistering-plasters must be applied to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>legs and arms, and the body rubbed all over with
warm flannels. Warm poultices may likewise be
applied to the feet and palms of the hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>When purple or black spots appear, the patient’s
drink should be sharpened with spirits of vitriol;
and if the putrid symptoms increase, the Peruvian
bark must be administered in the same manner as
directed in the small-pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opiates are sometimes necessary, but should
never be given except in cases of extreme restlessness,
a violent looseness, or when the cough is very
troublesome. For children, the syrup of poppies
is sufficient. A tea-spoonful or two may be occasionally
given, according to the patient’s age, or
the violence of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the measles are gone off, the patient ought
to be purged. This may be conducted in the same
manner as directed in the small-pox.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a violent looseness succeeds the measles, it
may be checked by taking for some days a gentle
dose of rhubarb in the morning, and an opiate over
night; but if these do not remove it, bleeding will
seldom fail to have that effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Patients recovering after the measles should be
careful what they eat or drink. Their food for
some time ought to be light, and in small quantities,
and their drink diluting, and rather of an
opening nature, as butter-milk, whey, and such
like. They ought also to beware of exposing
themselves too soon to the cold air, lest a suffocating
catarrh, an asthma, or a consumption of the
lungs, should ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should a cough, with difficulty of breathing, and
other symptoms of a consumption, remain after the
measles, small quantities of blood may be frequently
let at proper intervals, as the patient’s
strength and constitution will permit. He ought likewise
to drink asses milk, to remove to a free air, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>in a large town, and to ride daily on horseback.
He must keep close to a diet consisting of milk and
vegetables; and lastly, if these do not succeed, let
him remove to a warmer climate<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c010'><sup>[98]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE SCARLET FEVER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The scarlet fever is so called from the colour of
the patient’s skin, which appears as if it were tinged
with red wine. It happens at any season of the
year, but is most common towards the end of
summer; at which time it often seizes whole families;
children and young persons are most subject
to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>It begins like other fevers, with coldness and shivering,
without any violent sickness. Afterwards
the skin is covered with red spots, which are broader,
more florid, and less uniform than the measles.
They continue two or three days, and then disappear;
after which the cuticle, or scarf-skin, falls
off.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>There is seldom any occasion for medicine in
this disease. The patient ought however to keep
within doors, to abstain from flesh, strong liquors,
and cordials, and to drink freely of cool diluting
liquors. If the fever runs high, the body must be
kept gently open by emollient clysters, or small
doses of nitre and rhubarb. A scruple of the former,
with five grains of the latter, may be taken thrice
a-day, or oftener, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children and young persons are sometimes seized
at the beginning of this disease with a kind of
stupor and epileptic fits. In this case the feet and
legs should be bathed in warm water, a large blistering-plaster
applied to the neck, and a dose of
the syrup of poppies given every night till the patient
recovers<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c010'><sup>[99]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scarlet fever however is not always of so
mild a nature. It is sometimes attended with putrid
or malignant symptoms, in which case it is always
dangerous. In the malignant scarlet fever
the patient is not only affected with coldness and
shivering, but with languor, sickness, and great
oppression, to these succeed excessive heat, nausea
and vomiting, with a soreness of the throat; the
pulse is extremely quick, but small and depressed;
the breathing frequent and laborious; the skin hot,
but not quite dry; the tongue moist, and covered
with a whitish mucus; the tonsils inflamed and ulcerated.
When the eruption appears, it brings no
relief: on the contrary, the symptoms generally
grow worse, and fresh ones come on, as purging,
delirium, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this disease is mistaken for a simple inflammation,
and treated with repeated bleedings,
purging and cooling medicines, it generally proves
fatal. The only medicines that can be depended
on in this case are cordials and antiseptics, as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Peruvian bark, wine, snake-root, and the like.
The treatment must be in general similar to that of
the putrid fever, or of the malignant ulcerous sore
throat<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c010'><sup>[100]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE BILIOUS FEVER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When a continual, remitting, or intermitting fever
is accompanied with a frequent or copious evacuation
of bile, either by vomit or stool, the fever
is denominated bilious. In Britain the bilious fever
generally makes its appearance about the end
of summer, and ceases towards the approach of
winter. It is most frequent and fatal in warm
countries, especially where the soil is marshy, and
when great rains are succeeded by sultry heats.
Persons who work without doors, lie in camps, or
who are exposed to the night air, are most liable to
this kind of fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there are symptoms of inflammation at the
beginning of this fever, it will be necessary to
bleed, and to put the patient upon the cool diluting
regimen recommended in the inflammatory
fever. The saline draught may likewise be frequently
administered, and the patient’s body kept
open by clysters or mild purgatives. But if the
fever should remit or intermit, bleeding will seldom
be necessary. In this case a vomit may be administered,
and, if the body be bound, a gentle purge;
after which the Peruvian bark will generally complete
the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>In case of a violent looseness, the patient must
be supported with chicken broth, jellies of hartshorn,
and the like; and he may use the <i>white decoction</i>
for his ordinary drink<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c010'><sup>[101]</sup></a>. If a bloody flux
should accompany this fever, it must be treated in
the manner recommended under the article <i>Dysentery</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When there is a burning heat, and the patient
does not sweat, that evacuation may be promoted
by giving him, three or four times a day, a table-spoonful
of Mindererus’s spirit<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c010'><sup>[102]</sup></a> mixed in a cup of
his ordinary drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the bilious fever be attended with the nervous,
malignant, or putrid symptoms, which is sometimes
the case, the patient must be treated in the
same manner as directed under these diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>After this fever, proper care is necessary to prevent
a relapse. For this purpose the patient, especially
towards the end of autumn, ought to continue
the use of the Peruvian bark for some time after
he is well. He should likewise abstain from all
trashy fruits, new liquors, and every kind of flatulent
aliment.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE ERYSIPELAS, <span class='sc'>or St. ANTHONY’S</span> FIRE.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This disease, which in some parts of Britain is
called <i>the rose</i>, attacks persons at any period of
life, but is most common between the age of thirty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>and forty. Persons of a sanguine or plethoric habit
are most liable to it. It often attacks young people,
and pregnant women; and such as have once been
afflicted with it are very liable to have it again.
Sometimes it is a primary disease, and at other times
only a symptom of some other malady. Every part
of the body is liable to be attacked by an erysipelas,
but it most frequently seizes the legs or face, especially
the latter. It is most common in autumn, or
when hot weather is succeeded by cold and wet.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The erysipelas may be occasioned
by violent passions or affections of the mind; as
fear, anger, &#38;c. When the body has been heated
to a great degree, and is immediately exposed to
the cold air, so that the perspiration is suddenly
checked, an erysipelas will often ensue<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c010'><sup>[103]</sup></a>. It may
also be occasioned by drinking to excess, by continuing
too long in a warm bath, or by any thing
that overheats the blood. If any of the natural
evacuations be obstructed, or in too small quantity,
it may cause an erysipelas. The same effect will
follow from the stoppage of artificial evacuations;
as issues, setons, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The erysipelas attacks with
shivering, thirst, loss of strength, pain in the head
and back, heat, restlessness, and a quick pulse; to
which may be added vomiting, and sometimes a
delirium. On the second, third, or fourth day,
the part swells, becomes red, and small pustules appear
at which time the fever generally abates.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>When the erysipelas seizes the foot, the parts
contiguous swell, the skin shines; and, if the pain
be violent, it will ascend to the leg, and will not
bear to be touched.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it attacks the face, it swells, appears red,
and the skin is covered with small pustules filled
with clear water. One or both eyes are generally
closed with the swelling; and there is a difficulty of
breathing. If the mouth and nostrils be very dry,
and the patient drowsy, there is reason to suspect an
inflammation of the brain.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the erysipelas affects the breast, it swells and
becomes exceedingly hard, with great pain, and is
apt to suppurate. There is a violent pain in the
arm-pit on the side affected, where an abscess is
often formed.</p>

<p class='c008'>If in a day or two the swelling subsides, the heat
and pain abate, the colour of the part turns yellow,
and the cuticle breaks and falls off in scales, the
danger is over.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the erysipelas is large, deep, and affects a
very sensible part of the body, the danger is great.
If the red colour changes into a livid or black, it
will end in a mortification. Sometimes the inflammation
cannot be discussed, but comes to a suppuration;
in which case fistulas, a gangrene, or mortification,
often ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as die of this disease are commonly carried
off by the fever, which is attended with difficulty
of breathing, and sometimes with a delirium and
great drowsiness. They generally die about the seventh
or eighth day.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——In the erysipelas the patient
must neither be kept too hot nor too cold, as either
of these extremes will tend to make it retreat, which
is always to be guarded against. When the disease
is mild, it will be sufficient to keep the patient within
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>doors, without confining him to his bed, and to
promote the perspiration by diluting liquors, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet ought to be slender, and of a moderately
cooling and moistening quality, as groat-gruel, panado,
chicken or barley-broth, with cooling herbs
and fruits, &#38;c. avoiding flesh, fish, strong drink,
spices, pickles, and all other things that may heat
and inflame the blood; the drink may be barley-water,
an infusion of elder-flowers, common whey,
and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the pulse be low, and the spirits sunk, the
patient must be supported with negus, and other
things of a cordial nature. His food may be sago-gruel
with a little wine, and nourishing broths taken
in small quantities, and often repeated. Great care
however must be taken not to overheat him.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——In this disease much mischief
is often done by medicine, especially by external
applications. People, when they see an inflammation,
immediately think that something ought to
be applied to it. This indeed is necessary in large
phlegmons; but in an erysipelas the safer course is
to apply nothing. Almost all ointments, salves, and
plasters, being of a greasy nature, tend rather to obstruct
and repel, than promote any discharge from
the part. At the beginning of this disease it is
neither safe to promote a suppuration, nor to repel
the matter too quickly. The erysipelas in many
respects resembles the gout, and is to be treated
with the greatest caution. Fine wool, or very soft
flannel, are the safest applications to the part. These
not only defend it from the external air, but likewise
promote the perspiration, which has a great
tendency to carry off the disease. In Scotland the
common people generally apply a mealy cloth to the
parts affected, which is far from being improper.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is common to bleed in the erysipelas; but this
likewise requires caution. If however the fever be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>high, the pulse hard and strong, and the patient
vigorous, it will be proper to bleed; but the quantity
must be regulated by these circumstances, and
the operation repeated as the symptoms may require.
If the patient has been accustomed to strong liquors,
and the disease attacks his head, bleeding is absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bathing the feet and legs frequently in lukewarm
water, when the disease attacks the face or brain,
has an excellent effect. It tends to make a derivation
from the head, and seldom fails to relieve the
patient. When bathing proves ineffectual, poultices,
or sharp sinapisms, may be applied to the
soles of the feet, for the same purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>In cases where bleeding is requisite, it is likewise
necessary to keep the body open. This may be effected
by emollient clysters, or small doses of nitre
and rhubarb. Some indeed recommend very large
doses of nitre in the erysipelas; but nitre seldom sits
easy on the stomach when taken in large doses. It
is however one of the best medicines when the fever
and inflammation run high. Half a drachm of it,
with four or five grains of rhubarb, may be taken
in the patient’s ordinary drink, four times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the erysipelas leaves the extremities, and
seizes the head so as to occasion a delirium or stupor,
it is absolutely necessary to open the body. If clysters
and mild purgatives fail to have this effect, stronger
ones must be given. Blistering plasters must likewise
be applied to the neck, or behind the ears, and
sharp cataplasms laid to the soles of the feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the inflammation cannot be discussed, and
the part has a tendency to ulcerate, it will then be
proper to promote suppuration, which may be done
by the application of ripening poultices with saffron,
warm fomentations, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the black, livid, or blue colour of the part
shews a tendency to mortification, the Peruvian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>bark must be administered. It may be taken along
with acids, as recommended in the small-pox, or
in any other form more agreeable to the patient.
It must not however be trifled with, as the patient’s
life is at stake. A drachm may be given every two
hours, if the symptoms be threatening, and cloths
dipped in warm camphorated spirits of wine, or the
tincture of myrrh and aloes, may be applied to the
part, and frequently renewed. It may likewise be
proper in this case to apply poultices of the bark,
or to foment the part affected with a strong decoction
of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In what is commonly called the <i>scorbutic erysipelas</i>,
which continues for a considerable time, it will only
be necessary to give gentle laxatives, and such things
as purify the blood and promote the perspiration.
Thus, after the inflammation has been checked by
opening medicines, the decoction of woods<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c010'><sup>[104]</sup></a> may
be drank, after which a course of bitters will be
proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as are liable to frequent attacks of the erysipelas
ought carefully to guard against all violent
passions; to abstain from strong liquors, and all fat,
viscid, and highly nourishing food. They should
likewise take sufficient exercise, carefully avoiding
the extremes of heat or cold. Their food should
consist chiefly of milk, and such fruits, herbs, and
roots, as are of a cooling quality; and their drink
ought to be small-beer, whey, butter-milk, and
such like. They should never suffer themselves to
be long costive. If that cannot be prevented by
suitable diet, it will be proper to take frequently a
gentle dose of rhubarb, cream of tartar, the lenitive
electuary, or some other mild purgative.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXVI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE PHRENITIS, <span class='fss'>OR</span> INFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This is sometimes a primary disease, but oftener
only a symptom of some other malady; as the
inflammatory, eruptive, or spotted fever, &#38;c. It
is very common however as a primary disease in
warm climates, and is most incident to persons
about the prime or vigour of life. The passionate,
the studious, and those whose nervous system is irritable
in a high degree, are most liable to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——This disease is often occasioned by
night-watching, especially when joined with hard
study: it may likewise proceed from hard drinking,
anger, grief, or anxiety. It is often occasioned by
the stoppage of usual evacuations; as the bleeding
piles in men, the customary discharges of women,
&#38;c. Such as imprudently expose themselves to the
heat of the sun, especially by sleeping without doors
in a hot season with their heads uncovered, are often
suddenly seized with an inflammation of the brain,
so as to awake quite delirious. When repellents
are imprudently used in an erysipelas, an inflammation
of the brain is sometimes the consequence. It
may likewise be occasioned by external injuries, as
blows or bruises upon the head, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The symptoms which usually
precede a true inflammation of the brain are pain
of the head, redness of the eyes, a violent flushing
of the face, disturbed sleep, or a total want of it,
great dryness of the skin, costiveness, a retention
of urine, a small dropping of blood from the nose,
singing of the ears, and extreme sensibility of the
nervous system.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>When the inflammation is formed, the symptoms
in general are similar to those of the inflammatory
fever. The pulse indeed is often weak, irregular,
and trembling; but sometimes it is hard and contracted.
When the brain itself is inflamed, the
pulse is always soft and low; but when the inflammation
only affects the integuments of the brain,
viz. the dura and pia mater, it is hard. A remarkable
quickness of hearing is a common symptom
of this disease; but that seldom continues
long. Another usual symptom is a great throbbing
or pulsation in the arteries of the neck and temples.
Though the tongue is often black and dry, yet the
patient seldom complains of thirst, and even refuses
drink. The mind chiefly runs upon such objects
as have before made a deep impression on it;
and sometimes, from a sullen silence, the patient
becomes all of a sudden quite outrageous.</p>

<p class='c008'>A constant trembling and starting of the tendons
is an unfavourable symptom, as are also a
suppression of urine; a total want of sleep; a constant
spitting; a grinding of the teeth, which last
may be considered as a kind of convulsion. When
a phrenitis succeeds an inflammation of the lungs,
of the intestines, or of the throat, &#38;c. it is owing
to a translation of the disease from these parts to
the brain, and generally proves fatal. This shews
the necessity of proper evacuations, and the danger
of repellents in all inflammatory diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The favourable symptoms are, a free perspiration,
a copious discharge of blood from the nose,
the bleeding piles, a plentiful discharge of urine,
which lets fall a copious sediment. Sometimes the
disease is carried off by a looseness, and in women
by an excessive flow of the <i>menses</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>As this disease often proves fatal in a few days,
it requires the most speedy applications. When it
is prolonged, or improperly treated, it sometimes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>ends in madness, or a kind of stupidity which continues
for life.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the cure, two things are chiefly to be attended
to, <i>viz.</i> to lessen the quantity of blood in the
brain, and to retard the circulation towards the
head.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The patient ought to be kept
very quiet. Company, noise, and every thing that
affects the senses, or disturbs the imagination, increases
the disease. Even too much light is hurtful:
for which reason the patient’s chamber ought
to be a little darkened, and he should neither be
kept too hot nor cold. It is not however necessary
to exclude the company of an agreeable friend, as
this has a tendency to sooth and quiet the mind.
Neither ought the patient to be kept too much in
the dark, lest it should occasion a gloomy melancholy,
which is too often the consequence of this
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient must, as far as possible, be soothed
and humoured in every thing. Contradiction will
ruffle his mind, and increase his malady. Even
when he calls for things which are not to be obtained,
or which might prove hurtful, he is not to
be positively denied them, but rather put off with
the promise of having them as soon as they can be
obtained, or by some other excuse. A little of
any thing that the mind is set upon, though not
quite proper, will hurt the patient less than a positive
refusal. In a word, whatever he was fond of,
or used to be delighted with when in health, may
here be tried, as pleasing stories, soft music, or
whatever has a tendency to sooth the passions and
compose the mind. Boerhaave proposes several
mechanical experiments for this purpose; as the
soft noise of water distilling by drops into a bason,
and the patient trying to reckon them, &#38;c. Any
uniform sound, if low and continued, has a tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>to procure sleep, and consequently may be of
service.</p>

<p class='c008'>The aliment ought to be light, consisting chiefly
of farinaceous substances; as panado, and water-gruel
sharpened with jelly of currants, or juice of
lemons, ripe fruits roasted or boiled, jellies, preserves,
&#38;c. The drink small, diluting, and cooling;
as whey, barley-water, or decoctions of barley
and tamarinds, which latter not only render the
liquor more palatable, but likewise more beneficial,
as they are of an opening nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——In an inflammation of the
brain, nothing more certainly relieves the patient
than a free discharge of blood from the nose.
When this comes of its own accord, it is by no
means to be stopped, but rather promoted, by applying
cloths dipped in warm water to the part.
When bleeding at the nose does not happen spontaneously,
it may be provoked, by putting a straw,
or any other sharp body, up the nostril.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding in the temporal arteries greatly relieves
the head: but as this operation cannot always be
performed, we would recommend in its stead bleeding
in the jugular veins. When the patient’s pulse
and spirits are so low, that he cannot bear bleeding
with the lancet, leeches may be applied to the temples.
These not only draw off the blood more
gradually, but by being applied nearer to the part
affected, generally give more immediate relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>A discharge of blood from the hæmorrhoidal
veins is likewise of great service, and ought by all
means to be promoted. If the patient has been
subject to the bleeding piles, and that discharge
has been stopped, every method must be tried to
restore it; as the application of leeches to the parts,
sitting over the steams of warm water, sharp clysters,
or suppositories made of honey, aloes, and
rock-salt.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>If the inflammation of the brain be occasioned
by the stoppage of evacuations either natural or artificial,
as the menses, issues, setons, or such like,
all means must be used to restore them as soon as
possible, or to substitute others in their stead.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s body must be kept open by stimulating
clysters or smart purges; and small quantities
of nitre ought frequently to be mixed with his
drink. Two or three drachms, or more, if the
case be dangerous, may be used in the space of
twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The head should be shaved and frequently rubbed
with vinegar and rose-water. Cloths dipped in
this mixture may likewise be applied to the temples.
The feet ought frequently to be bathed in lukewarm
water, and soft poultices of bread and milk
may be kept constantly applied to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disease proves obstinate, and does not yield
to these medicines, it will be necessary to apply a
blistering-plaster to the whole head.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXVII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE OPHTHALMIA, <span class='fss'>OR</span> INFLAMMATION OF THE EYES.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This disease may be occasioned by external
injuries; as blows, burns, bruises, and the
like. It may likewise proceed from dust, quicklime,
or other substances, getting into the eyes. It
is often caused by the stoppage of customary evacuations;
as the healing of old sores, drying up of
issues, the suppressing of gentle morning sweats, or
of the sweating of the feet, &#38;c. Long exposure
to the night air, especially in cold northerly winds,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>or whatever suddenly checks the perspiration, especially
after the body has been much heated, is very
apt to cause an inflammation of the eyes. Viewing
snow or other white bodies for a long time, or
looking stedfastly at the sun, a clear fire, or any
bright object, will likewise occasion this malady.
A sudden transition from darkness to very bright
light will often have the same effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing more certainly occasions an inflammation
of the eyes than night-watching, especially
reading or writing by candle-light. Drinking spirituous
liquors, and excess of venery, are likewise
very hurtful to the eyes. The acrid fumes of metals,
and of several kinds of fuel, are also pernicious.
Sometimes an inflammation of the eyes
proceeds from a venereal taint, and often from a
scrophulous or gouty habit. It may likewise be occasioned
by hairs in the eye-lids turning inwards,
and hurting the eyes. Sometimes the disease is
epidemic, especially after wet seasons; and I have
frequently known it prove infectious, particularly
to those who lived in the same house with the patient.
It may be occasioned by moist air, or living
in low damp houses, especially in persons who are
not accustomed to such situations. In children it
often proceeds from imprudently drying up of scabbed
heads, a running behind the ears, or any other
discharge of that kind. Inflammations of the eyes
often succeed the small-pox or measles, especially
in children of a scrophulous habit.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——An inflammation of the eyes
is attended with acute pain, heat, redness, and
swelling. The patient is not able to bear the light,
and sometimes he feels a pricking pain, as if his
eyes were pierced with a thorn. Sometimes he
imagines his eyes are full of motes, or thinks he
sees flies dancing before him. The eyes are filled
with a scalding rheum, which rushes forth in great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>quantities, whenever the patient attempts to look
up. The pulse is generally quick and hard, with
some degree of fever. When the disease is violent,
the neighbouring parts swell, and there is a throbbing
or pulsation in the temporal arteries, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A slight inflammation of the eyes, especially
from an external cause, is easily cured; but when
the disease is violent, and continues long, it often
leaves specks upon the eyes, or dimness of sight,
and sometimes total blindness.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be seized with a looseness, it has
a good effect; and when the inflammation passes
from one eye to another, as it were by infection, it
is no unfavourable symptom. But when the disease
is accompanied with a violent pain of the
head, and continues long, the patient is in danger
of losing his sight.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The diet, unless in scrophulous
cases, can hardly be too spare, especially at the beginning.
The patient must abstain from every
thing of a heating nature. His food should consist
chiefly of mild vegetables, weak broths, and
gruels. His drink may be barley-water, balm-tea,
common whey, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s chamber must be darkened, or his
eyes shaded by a cover, so as to exclude the light,
but not to press upon the eyes. He should not
look at a candle, the fire, or any luminous object,
and ought to avoid all smoke, as the fumes of tobacco,
or any thing that may cause coughing,
sneezing, or vomiting. He should be kept quiet,
avoiding all violent efforts, either of body or mind,
and encouraging sleep as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——This is one of those diseases
wherein great hurt is often done by external applications.
Almost every person pretends to be possessed
of a remedy for the cure of sore eyes. These
remedies generally consist of eye-waters and ointments,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>with other external applications, which do
mischief twenty times for once they do good. People
ought therefore to be very cautious how they
use such things, as even the pressure upon the eyes
often increases the malady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding, in a violent inflammation of the eyes,
is always necessary. This should be performed as
near the part affected as possible. An adult may
lose ten or twelve ounces of blood from the jugular
vein, and the operation may be repeated according
to the urgency of the symptoms. If it should not
be convenient to bleed in the neck, the same quantity
may be let from the arm, or any other part of
the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>Leeches are often applied to the temples, or under
the eyes, with good effect. The wounds must
be suffered to bleed for some hours, and if the
bleeding stop soon, it may be promoted by the application
of cloths dipt in warm water. In obstinate
cases, it will be necessary to repeat this operation
several times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opening and diluting medicines are by no means
to be neglected. The patient may take a small
dose of Glauber’s salts, and cream of tartar, every
second or third day, or a decoction of tamarinds
with senna. If these be not agreeable, gentle
doses of rhubarb and nitre, a little of the lenitive
electuary, or any other mild purgative, will answer
the same end. The patient at the same time must
drink freely of water-gruel, tea, whey, or any
other weak diluting liquor. He ought likewise
to take, at bed-time, a large draught of very
weak wine-whey, in order to promote perspiration.
His feet and legs must frequently be bathed in
lukewarm water, and his head shaved twice or
thrice a-week, and afterwards washed in cold water.
This has often a remarkably good effect.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>If the inflammation does not yield to these evacuations,
blistering-plasters must be applied to the
temples, behind the ears, or upon the neck, and
kept open for some time by the mild blistering ointment.
I have seldom known these, if long
enough kept open, fail to remove the most obstinate
inflammation of the eyes; but for this purpose
it is often necessary to continue the discharge
for several weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease has been of long standing, I
have seen very extraordinary effects from a seton in
the neck, or between the shoulders, especially the
latter. It should be put upwards and downwards,
or in the direction of the spine, and in the middle
between the shoulder-blades. It may be dressed
twice a-day with yellow basilicon. I have known
patients, who had been blind for a considerable
time, recover sight by means of a seton placed as
above. When the seton is put across the neck,
it soon wears out, and is both more painful and
troublesome than between the shoulders; besides,
it leaves a disagreeable mark, and does not discharge
so freely.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the heat and pain of the eyes are very great,
a poultice of bread and milk, softened with sweet
oil or fresh butter, may be applied to them, at least
all night; and they may be bathed with lukewarm
milk and water in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient cannot sleep, which is sometimes
the case, he may take twenty or thirty drops of
laudanum, or two spoonfuls of the syrup of poppies,
over night, more or less according to his age,
or the violence of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the inflammation is gone off, if the eyes
still remain weak and tender, they may be bathed
every night and morning with cold water and a
little brandy, six parts of the former to one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>latter. A method should be contrived by which
the eye can be quite immersed in the brandy and
water, where it should be kept for some time. I
have generally found this, or cold water and vinegar,
as good a strengthener of the eyes as any of
the most celebrated collyriums.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an inflammation of the eyes proceeds from
a scrophulous habit, it generally proves very obstinate.
In this case the patient’s diet must not be too
low, and he may be allowed to drink small negus,
or now and then a glass of wine, The most proper
medicine is the Peruvian bark, which may either
be given in substance, or prepared in the following
manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take an ounce of the bark in powder, with two
drachms of Winter’s bark, and boil them in an
English quart of water to a pint; when it has
boiled nearly long enough, add half an ounce of
liquorice-root sliced. Let the liquor be strained.
Two, three, or four table-spoonfuls, according to
the age of the patient, may be taken three or four
times a-day, It is impossible to say how long this
medicine should be continued, as the cure is sooner
performed in some than in others; but in general it
requires a considerable time to produce any lasting
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Cheyne says, ‘That Æthiops mineral never
fails in obstinate inflammations of the eyes, even
scrophulous ones, if given in a sufficient dose, and
duly persisted in.’ There is no doubt but this and
other preparations of mercury may be of singular
service in ophthalmias of long continuance, but
they ought always to be administered with the
greatest caution, or by persons of skill in physic.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be proper frequently to look into the eyes,
to see if any hairs be turned inwards, or pressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>upon them<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c010'><sup>[105]</sup></a>. These ought to be removed by
plucking them out with a pair of small pincers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are liable to frequent returns of this
disease, ought constantly to have an issue in one or
both arms. Bleeding or purging in the spring and
autumn, will be very beneficial to such persons.
They ought likewise to live with the greatest regularity,
avoiding strong liquor, and every thing of a
heating quality. Above all, let them avoid the
night-air and late studies<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c010'><sup>[106]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXVIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE QUINSEY, <span class='fss'>OR</span> INFLAMMATION OF THE THROAT.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This disease is very common in Britain, and is
frequently attended with great danger. It
prevails in the winter and spring, and is most fatal
to young people of a sanguine temperament.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——In general it proceeds from the
same causes as other inflammatory disorders, <i>viz.</i> an
obstructed perspiration, or whatever heats or inflames
the blood. An inflammation of the throat is often
occasioned by omitting some part of the covering
usually worn about the neck, by drinking cold liquor
when the body is warm, by riding or walking
against a cold northerly wind, or any thing that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>greatly cools the throat, and parts adjacent. It
may likewise proceed from the neglect of bleeding,
purging, or any customary evacuation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Singing, speaking loud and long, or whatever
strains the throat, may likewise cause an inflammation
of that organ. I have often known the quinsey
prove fatal to jovial companions, who, after sitting
long in a warm room, drinking hot liquors, and
singing with vehemence, were so imprudent as to
go abroad in the cold night-air. Sitting with wet
feet, or keeping on wet clothes, are very apt to
occasion, this malady. It is likewise frequently
occasioned by continuing long in a moist place,
sitting near an open window, sleeping in a damp
bed, sitting in a room that has been newly plastered,
&#38;c. I know people who never fail to have a sore
throat if they sit even but a short time in a room
that has been lately washed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Acrid or irritating food may likewise inflame the
throat, and occasion a quinsey. It may also proceed
from bones, pins, or other sharp substances
sticking in the throat, or from the caustic fumes of
metals or minerals, as arsenic, antimony, &#38;c. taken
in by the breath. This disease is sometimes epidemic
and infectious.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The inflammation of the
throat is evident from inspection, the parts appearing
red and swelled; besides, the patient complains of
pain in swallowing. His pulse is quick and hard,
with other symptoms of a fever. If blood be let, it
is generally covered with a tough coat of a whitish
colour, and the patient spits a tough phlegm. As
the swelling and inflammation increase, the breathing
and swallowing become more difficult; the pain
affects the ears; the eyes generally appear red; and
the face swells. The patient is often obliged to keep
himself in an erect posture, being in danger of suffocation;
there is a constant nausea, or inclination to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>vomit, and the drink, instead of passing into the
stomach, is often returned by the nose. The patient
is sometimes starved at last, merely from an inability
to swallow any kind of food.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the breathing is laborious, with straitnesss of
the breast, and anxiety, the danger is great. Though
the pain in swallowing be very great, yet while the
patient breathes easy, there is not so much danger·
An external swelling is no unfavourable symptom;
but if it suddenly falls, and the disease affects the
breast, the danger is very great. When a quinsey
is the consequence of some other disease, which has
already weakened the patient, his situation is dangerous.
A frothing at the mouth, with a swelled
tongue, a pale, ghastly countenance, and coldness
of the extremities, are fatal symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The regimen in this disease is
in all respects the same as in the pleurisy, or peripneumony.
The food must be light, and in small
quantity, and the drink plentiful, weak, and diluting,
mixed with acids.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is highly necessary that the patient be kept easy
and quiet. Violent affections of the mind, or great
efforts of the body, may prove fatal. He should
not even attempt to speak but in a low voice. Such
a degree of warmth as to promote a constant,
gentle sweat, is proper. When the patient is in
bed, his head ought to be raised a little higher than
usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is peculiarly necessary that the neck be kept
warm; for which purpose several folds of soft flannel
may be wrapt round it. That alone will often
remove a slight complaint of the throat, especially
if applied in due time. We cannot here omit observing
the propriety of a custom which prevails
among the peasants of Scotland. When they feel
any uneasiness of the throat, they wrap a stocking
about it all night. So effectual is this remedy, that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>many places it passes for a charm, and the stocking
is applied with particular ceremonies: the custom,
however, is undoubtedly a good one, and should
never be neglected. When the throat has been
thus wrapped up all night, it must not be exposed to
the cold air through the day, but a handkerchief or
a piece of flannel kept about it till the inflammation
be removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The jelly of black currants is a medicine very
much in esteem for complaints of the throat; and
indeed it is of some use. It should be almost constantly
kept in the mouth, and swallowed down
leisurely. It may likewise be mixed in the patient’s
drink, or taken any other way. When it cannot
be obtained, the jelly of red currants, or of mulberries,
may be used in its stead.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gargles for the throat are very beneficial, They
may be made of sage-tea, with a little vinegar and
honey, or by adding to half an English pint of the
pectoral decoction two or three spoonfuls of honey,
and the same quantity of currant-jelly. This may
be used three or four times a-day; and if the patient
be troubled with tough viscid phlegm, the gargle
may be rendered more sharp and cleansing, by
adding to it a tea-spoonful of the spirit of <i>sal
ammoniac</i>. Some recommend gargles made of a
decoction of the leaves or bark of the black currant-bush;
but where the jelly can be had, these are
unnecessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no disease wherein the benefit of bathing
the feet and legs in lukewarm water is more apparent:
that practice ought therefore never to be
neglected. If people were careful to keep warm, to
wrap up their throats with flannel, to bathe their feet
and legs in warm water, and to use a spare diet,
with diluting liquors, at the beginning of this disease,
it would seldom proceed to a great height, or
be attended with any danger; but when these precautions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>are neglected, and the disease becomes
violent, more powerful medicines are necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——An inflammation of the throat
being a most acute and dangerous distemper, which
sometimes takes off the patient very suddenly, it
will be proper, as soon as the symptoms appear,
to bleed in the arm, or rather in the jugular vein,
and to repeat the operation if circumstances require.</p>

<p class='c008'>The body should likewise be kept gently open.
This may either be done by giving the patient for
his ordinary drink a decoction of figs and tamarinds,
or small doses of rhubarb and nitre, as recommended
in the erysipelas. These may be increased according
to the age of the patient, and repeated till they
have the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have often known very good effects from a bit
of <i>sal prunel</i>, or purified nitre, held in the mouth,
and swallowed down as it melted. This promotes
the discharge of <i>saliva</i>, by which means it answers
the end of a gargle, while at the same time it
abates the fever, by promoting the discharge of
urine, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The throat ought likewise to be rubbed twice or
thrice a-day with a little of the volatile liniment.
This seldom fails to produce some good effects.
At the same time the neck ought to be carefully
covered with wool or flannel, to prevent the cold
from penetrating the skin, as this application renders
it very tender. Many other external applications
are recommended in this disease, as a swallow’s
nest, poultices made of the fungus called Jew’s ears,
album Græcum, &#38;c. But as we do not look upon
any of these to be preferable to a common poultice
of bread and milk, we shall take no farther notice
of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some recommend the gum guaiacum as a specific
in this disease. Half a dram of the gum in powder
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>may be made into an electuary with the rob of elderberries,
or the jelly of currants for a dose, and
repeated occasionally<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c010'><sup>[107]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Blistering upon the neck or behind the ears in
violent inflammations of the throat is very beneficial;
and in bad cases it will be necessary to lay
a blistering-plaster quite across the throat, so as to
reach from ear to ear. After the plasters are taken
off, the parts ought to be kept running by the application
of issue ointment, till the inflammation is
gone; otherwise, upon their drying up, the patient
will be in danger of a relapse.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient has been treated as above, a
suppuration seldom happens. This however is
sometimes the case, in spite of all endeavours to
prevent it. When the inflammation and swelling
continue, and it is evident that a suppuration will
ensue, it ought to be promoted by drawing the steam
of warm water into the throat through a tunnel, or
the like. Soft poultices ought likewise to be applied
outwardly, and the patient may keep a roasted
fig constantly in his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>It sometimes happens, before the tumour breaks,
that the swelling is so great, as entirely to prevent
any thing from getting down into the stomach. In
this case the patient must inevitably perish, unless
he can be supported in some other way. This can
only be done by nourishing clysters of broth, or
gruel with milk, &#38;c. Patients have often been
supported by these for Several days, till the tumour
has broke; and afterwards they have recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Not only the swallowing, but the breathing, is
often prevented by the tumour. In this case nothing
can save the patient’s life, but opening the
<i>trachea</i> or wind-pipe. As that has been often done
with success, no person, in such desperate circumstances,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>ought to hesitate a moment about the operation;
but as it can only be performed by a surgeon,
it is not necessary here to give any directions
about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a difficulty of swallowing is not attended
with an acute pain or inflammation, it is generally
owing to an obstruction of the glands about the
throat, and only requires that the part be kept
warm, and the throat frequently gargled with something
that may gently stimulate the glands, as a
decoction of figs with vinegar and honey; to which
may be added a little mustard, or a small quantity
of spirits. But this gargle is never to be used where
there are signs of an inflammation. This species
of <i>angina</i> has various names among the common
people, as <i>the pap of the throat</i>, the falling down
of the <i>almonds of the ears</i>, &#38;c. Accordingly, to remove
it, they lift the patient up by the hair of the
head, and thrust their fingers under his jaws, &#38;c.
all which practices are at best useless, and often
hurtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are subject to inflammations of the
throat, in order to avoid that disease, ought to live
temperate. Such as do not chuse to observe this
rule, must have frequent recourse to purging and
other evacuations, to discharge the superfluous humours.
They ought likewise to beware of catching
cold, and should abstain from aliment and medicines
of an astringent or stimulating nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>Violent exercise, by increasing the motion and
force of the blood, is apt to occasion an inflammation
of the throat, especially if cold liquor be
drank immediately after it, or the body suffered
suddenly to cool. Those who would avoid this
disease ought therefore, after speaking aloud, singing,
running, drinking warm liquor, or doing any
thing that may strain the throat, or increase the circulation
of the blood towards it, to take care to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>cool gradually, and to wrap some additional coverings
about their necks.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have often known persons who had been subject
to sore throats, entirely freed from that complaint
by only wearing a riband, or a bit of flannel,
constantly about their necks, or by wearing thicker
shoes, a flannel waistcoat, or the like. These may
seem trifling, but they have great effect. There is
danger indeed in leaving them off after persons
have been accustomed to them; but surely the inconveniency
of using such things for life, is not to
be compared with the danger which may attend
the neglect of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, after an inflammation, the glands of
the throat continue swelled, and become hard and
callous. This complaint is not easily removed,
and is often rendered dangerous by the too frequent
application of strong stimulating and styptic
medicines. The best method is to keep it warm,
and to gargle it twice a-day with a decoction of
figs sharpened a little with the elixir or spirit of
vitriol.</p>

<p class='c008'>OF THE MALIGNANT QUINSEY,
<span class='fss'>OR</span> PUTRID, ULCEROUS SORE
THROAT.</p>

<p class='c008'>This kind of quinsey is but little known in the
northern parts of Britain, though, for some time
past, it has been fatal in the more southern counties.
Children are more liable to it than adults,
females than males, and the delicate than those who
are hardy and robust. It prevails chiefly in autumn,
and is most frequent after a long course of damp or
sultry weather.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——This is evidently a contagious
distemper, and is generally communicated by infection.
Whole families, and even entire villages,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>often receive the infection from one person. This
ought to put people upon their guard against going
near such patients as labour under the disorder; as
by that means they endanger not only their own
lives, but likewise those of their friends and connexions.
Whatever tends to produce putrid or
malignant fevers, may likewise occasion the putrid
ulcerous sore throat, as unwholesome air, damaged
provisions, neglect of cleanliness, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——It begins with alternate fits
of shivering and heat. The pulse is quick, but
low and unequal, and generally continues so through
the whole course of the disease. The patient complains
greatly of weakness and oppression of the
breast, his spirits are low, and he is apt to faint
away when set upright; he is troubled with a nausea,
and often with a vomiting or purging. The
two latter are most common in children. The eyes
appear red and watery, and the face swells. The
urine is at first pale and crude; but, as the disease
advances, it turns more of a yellowish colour. The
tongue is white, and generally moist, which distinguishes
this from an inflammatory disease. Upon
looking into the throat it appears swelled, and of
a florid red colour. Pale or ash-coloured spots,
however, are here and there interspersed, and sometimes
one broad patch or spot, of an irregular
figure, and pale white colour, surrounded with florid
red, only appears. These whitish spots or sloughs
cover so many ulcers.</p>

<p class='c008'>An efflorescence, or eruption upon the neck,
arms, breast, and fingers, about the second or third
day, is a common symptom of this disease. When
it appears, the purging and vomiting generally
cease.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is often a slight degree of delirium, and
the face frequently appears bloated, and the inside
of the nostrils red and inflamed. The patient complains
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>of a disagreeable putrid smell, and his
breath is very offensive.</p>

<p class='c008'>The putrid, ulcerous sore throat may be distinguished
from the inflammatory by the vomiting and
looseness with which it is generally ushered in; the
foul ulcers in the throat covered with a white or livid
coat; and by the excessive weakness of the patient;
with other symptoms of a putrid fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>Unfavourable symptoms are, an obstinate purging,
extreme weakness, dimness of the sight, a livid
or black colour of the spots, and frequent shiverings,
with a weak, fluttering pulse. If the eruption
upon the skin suddenly disappears, or becomes
of a livid colour, with a discharge of blood from
the nose or mouth, the danger is very great.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a gentle sweat break out about the third or
fourth day, and continue with a slow, firm, and
equal pulse; if the sloughs cast off in a kindly
manner, and appear clean and florid at the bottom;
and if the breathing is soft and free, with a
lively colour of the eyes, there is reason to hope
for a salutary crisis.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The patient must be kept quiet,
and for the most part in bed, as he will be apt to
faint when taken out of it. His food must be nourishing
and restorative; as sago-gruel with red wine,
jellies, strong broths, &#38;c. His drink ought to be
generous, and of an antiseptic quality; as red-wine
negus, white-wine whey, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——The medicine in this kind of
quinsey is entirely different from that which is proper
in the inflammatory. All evacuations, as bleeding,
purging, &#38;c. which weaken the patient, must
be avoided. Cooling medicines, as nitre and cream
of tartar, are likewise hurtful. Strengthening cordials
alone can be used with safety; and these
ought never to be neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>If at the beginning there is a great nausea, or
inclination to vomit, the patient must drink an infusion
of green tea, camomile flowers, or <i>carduus
benedictus</i>, in order to cleanse the stomach. If these
are not sufficient, he may take a few grains of the
powder of ipecacuanha, or any other gentle vomit.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disease is mild, the throat may be gargled
with an infusion of sage and rose leaves, to a gill of
which may be added a spoonful or two of honey,
and as much vinegar as will make it agreeably acid;
but when the symptoms are urgent, the sloughs
large and thick, and the breath very offensive, the
following gargle may be used:</p>

<p class='c008'>To six or seven ounces of the pectoral decoction,
when boiling, add half an ounce of contrayerva-root;
let it boil for some time, and afterwards
strain the liquor; to which add two ounces of white-wine
vinegar, an ounce of fine honey, and an
ounce of the tincture of myrrh. This ought not
only to be used as a gargle, but a little of it should
frequently be injected with a syringe to clean the
throat, before the patient takes any meat or drink.
This method is peculiarly necessary for children,
who cannot use a gargle.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will be of great benefit if the patient frequently
receives into his mouth, through an inverted
funnel, the steams of warm vinegar, myrrh,
and honey.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the putrid symptoms run high, and the
disease is attended with danger, the only medicine
that can be depended upon is the Peruvian bark.
It may be taken in substance, if the patient’s stomach
will bear it. If not, an ounce of bark
grossly powdered, with two drachms of Virginian
snake-root, may be boiled in an English pint and a
half of water to half a pint; to which a tea-spoonful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>of the elixir of vitriol may be added, and an
ordinary tea-cupful of it taken every three or four
hours. Blistering-plasters are very beneficial in this
disease, especially when the patient’s pulse and spirits
are low. They may be applied to the throat,
behind the ears, or upon the back part of the
neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should the vomiting prove troublesome, it will
be proper to give the patient two table-spoonfuls
of the saline julep every hour. Tea made of mint
and a little cinnamon will be very proper for his
ordinary drink, especially if an equal quantity of
red-wine be mixed with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of a violent looseness, the size of a nutmeg
of <i>diascordium</i>, or the japonic confection, may
be taken two or three times a-day, or oftener if
necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a discharge of blood from the nose happens,
the steams of warm vinegar may be received up the
nostrils frequently; and the drink must be sharpened
with spirits of vitriol, or tincture of roses.</p>

<p class='c008'>In case of a strangury, the belly must be fomented
with warm water, and emollient clysters
given three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the violence of the disease is over, the body
should still be kept open with mild purgatives; as
manna, senna, rhubarb, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>If great weakness and dejection of spirits, or
night-sweats, with other symptoms of a consumption,
should ensue, we would advise the patient
to continue the use of the Peruvian bark, with the
elixir of vitriol, and to take frequently a glass of
generous wine. These, together with a milk diet,
and riding on horseback, are the most likely means
for recovering his strength.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXIX.<br> <span class='c015'>OF COLDS AND COUGHS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>It has already been observed, that colds are the
effect of an obstructed perspiration; the common
causes of which we have likewise endeavoured
to point out, and shall not here repeat them. Neither
shall we spend time in enumerating all the various
symptoms of colds, as they are pretty generally
known. It may not however be amiss to
observe, that almost every cold is a kind of fever,
which only differs in degree from some of those that
have already been treated of.</p>

<p class='c008'>No age, sex, or constitution, is exempted from
this disease; neither is it in the power of any medicine
or regimen to prevent it. The inhabitants
of every climate are liable to catch cold, nor can
even the greatest circumspection defend them at all
times from its attacks. Indeed, if the human body
could be kept constantly in an uniform degree of
warmth, such a thing as catching cold would be
impossible: but as that cannot be effected by any
means, the perspiration must be liable to many
changes. Such changes, however, when small, do
not affect the health; but, when great, they must
prove hurtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>When oppression of the breast, a stuffing of the
nose, unusual weariness, pain of the head, &#38;c. give
ground to believe that the perspiration is obstructed,
or, in other words, that the person has caught cold,
he ought immediately to lessen his diet, at least the
usual quantity of his solid food, and to abstain from
all strong liquors. Instead of flesh, fish, eggs,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>milk, and other nourishing diet, he may eat light
bread-pudding, veal or chicken broth, panado,
gruels, and such like. His drink may be water-gruel
sweetened with a little honey; an infusion of
balm, or linseed sharpened with the juice of orange
or lemon; a decoction of barley and liquorice,
with tamarinds, or any other cool, diluting, acid
liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Above all, his supper should be light; as small
posset, or water-gruel sweetened with honey, and a
little toasted bread in it. If honey should disagree
with the stomach, the gruel may be sweetened with
treacle or coarse sugar, and sharpened with the
jelly of currants. Those who have been accustomed
to generous liquors may take wine-whey
instead of gruel, which may be sweetened as above.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient ought to lie longer than usual a-bed,
and to encourage a gentle sweat, which is easily
brought on towards morning, by drinking tea, or
any kind of warm diluting liquor. I have often
known this practice carry off a cold in one day,
which in all probability, had it been neglected,
would have cost the patient his life, or have confined
him for some months. Would people sacrifice
a little time to ease and warmth, and practice
a moderate degree of abstinence when the first
symptoms of a cold appear, we have reason to believe,
that most of the bad effects which flow from
an obstructed perspiration might be prevented.
But, after the disease has gathered strength by delay,
all attempts to remove it often prove vain. A
pleurisy, a peripneumony, or a fatal consumption
of the lungs, are the common effects of colds
which have either been totally neglected or treated
improperly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many attempt to cure a cold, by getting drunk.
But this, to say no worse of it, is a very hazardous
experiment. No doubt it may sometimes succeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>by suddenly restoring the perspiration; but when
there is any degree of inflammation, which is frequently
the case, strong liquors, instead of removing
the malady, will increase it. By this means a
common cold may be converted into an inflammatory
fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>When those who labour for their daily bread
have the misfortune to catch cold, they cannot
afford to lose a day or two, in order to keep themselves
warm, and take a little medicine; by which
means the disorder is often so aggravated as to confine
them for a long time, or even to render them
ever after unable to sustain hard labour. But even
such of the labouring poor as can afford to take
care of themselves, are often too hardy to do it;
they affect to despise colds, and as long as they can
crawl about, scorn to be confined by what they
call a <i>common cold</i>. Hence it is, that colds destroy
such numbers of mankind. Like an enemy despised,
they gather strength from delay, till at length they
become invincible. We often see this verified in
travellers, who, rather than lose a day in the prosecution
of their business, throw away their lives by
pursuing their journey, even in the severest weather,
with this disease upon them.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is certain, however, that colds may be too
much indulged. When a person, for every slight
cold, shuts himself up in a warm room, and drinks
great quantities of warm liquor, it may occasion
such a general relaxation of the solids as will not be
easily removed. It will therefore be proper, when
the disease will permit, and the weather is mild, to
join to the regimen mentioned above gentle exercise;
as walking, riding on horseback, or in a carriage,
&#38;c. An obstinate cold, which no medicine
can remove, will yield to gentle exercise and a
proper regimen of the diet.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>Bathing the feet and legs in warm water has a
great tendency to restore the perspiration. But care
must be taken that the water be not too warm,
otherwise it will do hurt. It should never be much
warmer than the blood, and the patient should go
immediately to bed after using it. Bathing the feet
in warm water, lying in bed, and drinking warm
water-gruel, or other weak liquors, will sooner take
off a spasm, and restore the perspiration, than all
the hot sudorific medicines in the world. This is
all that is necessary for removing a common cold;
and if this course be taken at the beginning, it will
seldom fail.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the symptoms do not yield to abstinence,
warmth, and diluting liquors, there is reason
to fear the approach of some other disease, as
an inflammation of the breast, an ardent fever, or
the like. If the pulse therefore be hard and frequent,
the skin hot and dry, and the patient complains
of his head or breast, it will be necessary to
bleed, and to give the cooling powders recommended
in the scarlet fever every three or four
hours, till they give a stool.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will likewise be proper to put a blistering-plaster
on the back, to give two table-spoonfuls of
the saline mixture every two hours, and in short to
treat the patient in all respects as for a slight fever.
I have often seen this course, when observed at the
beginning, remove the complaint in two or three
days, when the patient had all the symptoms of an
approaching ardent fever, or an inflammation of
the breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chief secret of preventing colds lies in avoiding,
as far as possible, all extremes either of heat
or cold, and in taking care, when the body is
heated, to let it cool gradually. These and other
circumstances relating to this important subject,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>are so fully treated of under the article <i>Obstructed
Perspiration</i>, that it is needless here to resume the
consideration of them.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF A COMMON COUGH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A cough is generally the effect of a cold, which
has either been improperly treated, or entirely neglected.
When it proves obstinate, there is always
reason to fear the consequences, as this shews a
weak state of the lungs, and is often the forerunner
of a consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the cough be violent, and the patient young
and strong, with a hard quick pulse, bleeding will
be proper; but in weak and relaxed habits, bleeding
rather prolongs the disease. When the patient
spits freely, bleeding is unnecessary, and sometimes
hurtful, as it tends to lessen that discharge.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the cough is not attended with any degree
of fever, and the spittle is viscid and tough, sharp
pectoral medicines are to be administered; as gum
ammoniac, squills, &#38;c. Two table-spoonfuls of the
solution of gum ammoniac may be taken three or
four times a-day, more or less, according to the age
and constitution of the patient. Squills may be
given various ways; two ounces of the vinegar, the
oxymel, or the syrup, may be mixed with the same
quantity of simple cinnamon water, to which may
be added an ounce of common water and an ounce
of balsamic syrup. Two table-spoonfuls of this
mixture may be taken three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>A syrup made of equal parts of lemon-juice,
honey, and sugar-candy, is likewise very proper in
this kind of cough. A table-spoonful of it may be
taken at pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the defluxion is sharp and thin, these
medicines rather do hurt. In this case gentle opiates,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>oils, and mucilages, are more proper. A cup of an
infusion of wild poppy leaves, and marsh-mallow
roots, or the flowers of coltsfoot, may be taken
frequently; or a tea-spoonful of the paregoric elixir
may be put into the patient’s drink twice a-day.
Fuller’s Spanish infusion is also a very proper medicine
in this case, and may be taken in the quantity
of a tea-cupful three or four times a-day<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c010'><sup>[108]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a cough is occasioned by acrid humours
tickling the throat and <i>fauces</i>, the patient should
keep some soft pectoral lozenges almost constantly
in his mouth; as the Pontefract liquorice cakes,
barley-sugar, the common balsamic lozenges, Spanish
juice, &#38;c. These blunt the acrimony of the
humours, and by taking off their stimulating quality,
help to appease the cough<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c010'><sup>[109]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstinate coughs, proceeding from a flux of
humours upon the lungs, it will often be necessary,
besides expectorating medicines, to have recourse to
issues, setons, or some other drain. In this case I
have often observed the most happy effects from a
Burgundy-pitch plaster applied between the shoulders.
I have ordered this simple remedy in the most
obstinate coughs, in a great number of cases, and
in many different constitutions, without ever knowing
it fail to give relief, unless where there were
evident signs of an ulcer in the lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the bulk of a nutmeg of Burgundy-pitch
may be spread thin upon a piece of soft leather, about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>the size of the hand, and laid between the shoulder-blades.
It may be taken off and wiped every three
or four days, and ought to be renewed once a fortnight
or three weeks. This is indeed a cheap and
simple medicine, and consequently apt to be despised;
but we will venture to affirm, that the whole
<i>materia medica</i> does not afford an application more
efficacious in almost every kind of cough. It has
not indeed always an immediate effect; but, if kept
on for some time, it will succeed where most other
medicines fail.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only inconveniency attending this plaster is
the itching which it occasions; but surely this may
be dispensed with, considering the advantage which
the patient may expect to reap from the application;
besides, when the itching becomes very uneasy,
the plaster may be taken off, and the part rubbed
with a dry cloth, or washed with a little warm milk
and water. Some caution indeed is necessary in discontinuing
the use of such a plaster; this however
may be safely done by making it smaller by degrees,
and at length quitting it altogether in a warm
season<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c010'><sup>[110]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>But coughs proceed from many other causes besides
defluxions upon the lungs. In these cases the
cure is not to be attempted by pectoral medicines.
Thus, in a cough proceeding from a foulness and
debility of the stomach, syrups, oils, mucilages,
and all kinds of balsamic medicines do hurt. The
<i>stomach cough</i> may be known from one that is owing
to a fault in the lungs by this, that in the latter
the patient coughs whenever he inspires, or draws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>in his breath fully; but in the former that does not
happen.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cure of this cough depends chiefly upon
cleansing and strengthening the stomach; for which
purpose gentle vomits and bitter purgatives are most
proper. Thus, after a vomit or two, the sacred
tincture, as it is called, may be taken for a considerable
time in the dose of one or two table-spoonfuls
twice a-day, or as often as it is found necessary, to
keep the body gently open. People may make this
tincture themselves, by infusing an ounce of <i>hiera
picra</i><a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c010'><sup>[111]</sup></a> in an English pint of white wine, letting it
stand a few days, and then draining it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In coughs which proceed from a debility of the
stomach, the Peruvian bark is likewise of considerable
service. It may either be chewed, taken in
powder, or made into a tincture along with other
stomachic bitters.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>A nervous cough</i> can only be removed by change
of air and proper exercise; to which may be added
the use of gentle opiates. Instead of the saponaceous
pill, the paregoric elixir, &#38;c. which are only
opium disguised, ten, fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five
drops of liquid laudanum, more or less, as circumstances
require, may be taken at bed-time, or
when the cough is most troublesome. Immersing
the feet and hands in warm water will often appease
the violence of a nervous cough.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a cough is only the symptom of some other
malady, it is in vain to attempt to remove it without
first curing the disease from which it proceeds.
Thus when a cough is occasioned by <i>teething</i>, keeping
the body open, scarifying the gums, or whatever
facilitates the cutting of the teeth, likewise appeases
the cough. In like manner, when <i>worms</i> occasion
a cough, such medicines as remove these vermin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>will generally cure the cough; as bitter purgatives,
oily clysters, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women, during the last months of pregnancy,
are often greatly afflicted with a cough, which is
generally relieved by bleeding, and keeping the
body gently open. They ought to avoid all flatulent
food, and to wear a loose easy dress.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cough is not only a symptom, but is often likewise
the forerunner of diseases. Thus, the gout is
frequently ushered in by a very troublesome cough,
which affects the patient for some days before the
coming on of the fit. This cough is generally removed
by a paroxysm of the gout, which should
therefore be promoted, by keeping the extremities
warm, drinking warm liquors, and bathing the
feet and legs frequently in lukewarm water.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE HOOPING-COUGH, <span class='fss'>OR</span> CHIN-COUGH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This cough seldom affects adults, but proves often
fatal to children. Such children as live upon thin
watery diet, who breathe unwholesome air, and
have too little exercise, are most liable to this disease,
and generally suffer most from it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chin-cough is so well known, even to nurses,
that a description of it is unnecessary. Whatever
hurts the digestion, obstructs the perspiration, or
relaxes the solids, disposes to this disease: consequently
its cure must depend upon cleansing and
strengthening the stomach, bracing the solids, and
at the same time promoting perspiration and the
different secretions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet must be light, and of easy digestion; for
children, good bread made into pap or pudding,
chicken-broth, with other light spoon meats, are
proper; but those who are farther advanced may be
allowed sago-gruel, and if the fever be not high, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>little boiled chicken, or other white meats. The
drink may be hyssop, or penny-royal tea, sweetened
with honey or sugar-candy, small wine-whey; or,
if the patient be weak, he may sometimes be allowed
a little negus.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most effectual remedies in the chin-cough
is change of air. This often removes the
malady, even when the change seems to be from a
purer to a less wholesome air. This may in some
measure depend on the patient’s being removed
from the place where the infection prevails. Most
of the diseases of children are infectious; nor is it
at all uncommon to find the chin-cough prevailing
in one town or village, when another, at a very
small distance, is quite free from it. But whatever
be the cause, we are sure of the fact. No time
ought therefore to be lost in removing the patient
at some distance from the place where he caught
the disease, and, if possible, into a more pure and
warm air<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c010'><sup>[112]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease proves violent, and the patient
is in danger of being suffocated by the cough, he
ought to be bled, especially if there be a fever with
a hard full pulse. But as the chief intention of
bleeding is to prevent an inflammation of the lungs,
and to render it more safe to give vomits, it will seldom
be necessary to repeat the operation; yet if
there are symptoms of an inflammation of the lungs,
a second or even a third bleeding may be requisite.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally reckoned a favourable symptom
when a fit of coughing makes the patient vomit.
This cleanses the stomach, and greatly relieves the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>cough. It will therefore be proper to promote this
discharge, either by small doses of ipecacuanha, or
the vomiting julep recommended in the Appendix<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c010'><sup>[113]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very difficult to make children drink after a
vomit. I have often seen them happily deceived,
by infusing a scruple or half a drachm of the powder
of ipecacuanha in a tea-pot, with half an English
pint of boiling water. If this be disguised with a
few drops of milk and a little sugar, they will imagine
it tea, and drink it very greedily. A small
tea-cupful of this may be given every quarter of an
hour, or rather every ten minutes, till it operates.
When the child begins to puke, there will be no
occasion for drinking any more, as the water already
on the stomach will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vomits not only cleanse the stomach, which in
this disease is generally loaded with viscid phlegm,
but they likewise promote the perspiration and other
secretions, and ought therefore to be repeated according
to the obstinacy of the disease. They
should not however be strong; gentle vomits frequently
repeated are both less dangerous, and more
beneficial than strong ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>The body ought to be kept gently open. The
best medicines for this purpose are rhubarb and its
preparations, as the syrup, tincture, &#38;c. Of these
a tea-spoonful or two may be given to an infant twice
or thrice a-day, as there is occasion. To such as
are farther advanced, the dose must be proportionally
increased, and repeated till it has the desired
effect. Those who cannot be brought to take
the bitter tincture, may have an infusion of senna
and prunes, sweetened with manna, coarse sugar,
or honey; or a few grains of rhubarb mixed with
a tea-spoonful or two of syrup, or currant jelly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>so as to disguise the taste. Most children are fond
of syrups and jellies, and seldom refuse even a disagreeable
medicine when mixed with them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people believe that oily, pectoral, and
balsamic medicines possess wonderful virtues for the
cure of the chin-cough, and accordingly exhibit
them plentifully to patients of every age and constitution,
without considering that every thing of
this nature must load the stomach, hurt the digestion,
and of course aggravate the disorder<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c010'><sup>[114]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>millepedes</i>, or woodlice, are greatly recommended
for the cure of a chin-cough. Those
who chuse to make use of these insects, may infuse
two ounces of them bruised in an English pint of
small white-wine for one night. Afterwards the liquor
may be drained through a cloth, and a table-spoonful
of it given to the patient three or four
times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opiates are sometimes necessary to allay the violence
of the cough. For this purpose a little of the
syrup of poppies, or five, six, or seven drops of
laudanum, according to the age of the patient, may
be taken in a cup of hyssop or penny-royal-tea, and
repeated occasionally<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c010'><sup>[115]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The garlic ointment is a well-known remedy in
North Britain for the chin-cough. It is made by
beating in a mortar garlic with an equal quantity
of hogs lard. With this the soles of the feet may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>be rubbed twice or thrice a-day; but the best method
is to spread it upon a rag, and apply it in the
form of plaster. It should be renewed every night
and morning at least, as the garlic soon loses its
virtue. This is an exceeding good medicine both
in the chin-cough, and in most other coughs of an
obstinate nature. It ought not however to be used
when the patient is very hot or feverish, lest it
should increase these symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>The feet should be bathed once every two or
three days in lukewarm water; and a Burgundy-pitch
plaster kept constantly between the shoulders.
But when the disease proves very violent, it will be
necessary, instead of it, to apply a blistering-plaster,
and to keep the part open for some time with issue ointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is prolonged, and the patient
is free from a fever, the Peruvian bark, and other
bitters, are the most proper medicines. The bark
may either be taken in substance, or in a decoction
or infusion, as is most agreeable. For a child, ten,
fifteen, or twenty grains, according to the age of
the patient, may be given three or four times a day.
For an adult, half a drachm or two scruples will
be proper. Some give the extract of the bark with
cantharides; but to manage this requires a considerable
attention. It is more safe to give a few
grains of castor along with the bark. A child of
six or seven years of age may take seven or eight
grains of castor, with fifteen grains of powdered
bark, for a dose. This may be made into a mixture
with two or three ounces of any simple distilled
water, and a little syrup, and taken three or four
times a-day.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXX.<br> <span class='c015'>INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH, AND OTHER VISCERA.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>All inflammations of the bowels are dangerous,
and require the most speedy assistance; as they
frequently end in a suppuration, and sometimes in
a mortification, which is certain death.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——An inflammation of the stomach
may proceed from any of the causes which produce
an inflammatory fever; as cold liquor drank while
the body is warm, obstructed perspiration, or the
sudden striking in of any eruption. It may likewise
proceed from the acrimony of the bile, or from
acrid and stimulating substances taken into the stomach;
as strong vomits or purges, corrosive poisons,
and such like. When the gout has been repelled
from the extremities, either by cold or improper
applications, it often occasions an inflammation of
the stomach. Hard or indigestible substances taken
into the stomach, as bones, the stones of fruit, &#38;c.
may likewise have that effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——It is attended with a fixed
pain and burning heat in the stomach; great restlessness
and anxiety; a small, quick, and hard pulse;
vomiting, or, at least, a nausea and sickness; excessive
thirst; coldness of the extremities; difficulty
of breathing; cold clammy sweats; and
sometimes convulsions and fainting fits. The stomach
is swelled, and often feels hard to the touch.
One of the most certain signs of this disease is the
sense of pain, which the patient feels upon taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>any kind of food or drink, especially if it be either
too hot or too cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient vomits every thing he eats or
drinks, is extremely restless, has a hiccup, with an
intermitting pulse, and frequent fainting fits, the
danger is very great.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——All acrimonious, heating, and
irritating food and drink are carefully to be avoided.
The weakness of the patient may deceive the bystanders,
and induce them to give him wines, spirits,
or other cordials; but these never fail to increase
the disease, and often occasion sudden death.
The inclination to vomit may likewise impose on
the attendants, and make them think a vomit necessary;
but that too is almost certain death.</p>

<p class='c008'>The food must be light, thin, cool, and easy of
digestion. It must be given in small quantities,
and should neither be quite cold nor too hot. Thin
gruel made of barley or oatmeal, light toasted
bread dissolved in boiling water, or very weak
chicken broth, are the most proper. The drink
should be clear whey, barley-water, water in which
toasted bread has been boiled, or decoctions of
emollient vegetables; as liquorice and marsh-mallow
roots, sarsaparilla, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Bleeding in this disease is absolutely
necessary, and is almost the only thing that
can be depended on. When the disease proves obstinate,
it will often be proper to repeat this operation
several times, nor must the low state of the
pulse deter us from doing so. The pulse indeed
generally rises upon bleeding, and as long as that
is the case, the operation is safe.</p>

<p class='c008'>Frequent fomentations with lukewarm water, or
a decoction of emollient vegetables, are likewise
beneficial. Flannel cloths dipped in these must be
applied to the region of the stomach, and removed
as they grow cool. They must neither be applied
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>too warm, nor be suffered to continue till they become
quite cold, as either of these extremities
would aggravate the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The feet and legs ought likewise to be frequently
bathed in lukewarm water, and warm bricks
or poultices may be applied to the soles of the feet.
The warm bath, if it can be conveniently used,
will be of great service.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this, and all other inflammations of the bowels,
an epispastic, or blistering-plaster, applied over the
part affected, is one of the best remedies I know.
I have often used it, and do not recollect one instance
wherein it did not give relief to the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only internal medicines which we shall venture
to recommend in this disease, are mild clysters.
These may be made of warm water, or thin water-gruel;
and if the patient is costive, a little sweet
oil, honey, or manna, may be added. Clysters
answer the purpose of an internal fomentation,
while they keep the body open, and at the same
time nourish the patient, who is often in this disease
unable to retain any food upon his stomach.
For these reasons they must not be neglected, as
the patient’s life may depend on them.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>INFLAMMATION OF THE INTESTINES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This is one of the most painful and dangerous
diseases that mankind is liable to. It generally
proceeds from the same <i>causes</i> as the inflammation
of the stomach; to which may be added costiveness,
worms, eating unripe fruits, or great quantities
of nuts, drinking hard windy malt liquors,
as stale bottled beer or ale, sour wine, cyder, &#38;c.
It may likewise be occasioned by a rupture, by
schirrous tumours of the intestines, or by their opposite
sides growing together.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>The inflammation of the intestines is denominated
<i>Iliac passion, Enteritis, &#38;c.</i> according to the
name of the parts affected. The treatment however
is nearly the same whatever part of the intestinal
canal be the seat of the disease; we shall therefore
omit these distinctions, lest they should perplex
the reader.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>symptoms</i> here are nearly the same as in the
foregoing disease; only the pain, if possible, is
more acute, and is situated lower. The vomiting
is likewise more violent, and sometimes even the
excrements, together with the clysters, are discharged
by the mouth. The patient is continually
belching up wind, and has often an obstruction of
his urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the pain shifts, and the vomiting only
returns at certain intervals, and while the clysters
pass downwards, there is ground for hope; but when
the clysters and <i>fæces</i> are vomited, and the patient
is exceeding weak, with a low fluttering pulse, a
pale countenance, and a disagreeable or stinking
breath, there is great reason to fear that the consequences
will prove fatal. Clammy sweats, black
fœtid stools, with a small intermitting pulse, and
a total cessation of pain, are signs of a mortification
already begun, and of approaching death.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The regimen in this disease is
in general the same as in an inflammation of the
stomach. The patient must be kept quiet, avoiding
cold, and all violent passions of the mind.
His food ought to be very light, and given in small
quantities; his drink weak and diluting; as clear
whey, barley-water, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Bleeding in this, as well as
in the inflammation of the stomach, is of the greatest
importance. It should be performed as soon as the
symptoms appear, and must be repeated according
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>to the strength of the patient, and the violence of
the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>A blistering plaster is here likewise to be applied
immediately over the part where the most violent
pain is. This not only relieves the pain of the
bowels, but even clysters and purgative medicines,
which before had no effect, will operate when the
blister begins to rise.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fomentations and laxative clysters are by no
means to be omitted. The patient’s feet and legs
should frequently be bathed in warm water; and
cloths dipped in it applied to his belly. Bladders
filled with warm water may likewise be applied to
the region of the navel, and warm bricks, or bottles
filled with warm water, to the soles of the feet.
The clysters may be made of barley-water or thin
gruel with salt, and softened with sweet oil or fresh
butter. These may be administered every two or
three hours, or oftener, if the patient continues
costive.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disease does not yield to clysters and fomentations,
recourse must be had to pretty strong
purgatives; but as these, by irritating the bowels,
often increase their contraction, and by that means
frustrate their own intention, it will be necessary
to join them with opiates, which, by allaying the
pain, and relaxing the spasmodic contractions of
the guts, greatly assist the operation of purgatives
in this case.</p>

<p class='c008'>What answers the purpose of opening the body
very well, is a solution of the bitter purging salts.
Two ounces of these may be dissolved in an English
pint of warm water, or thin gruel, and a tea-cupful
of it taken every half hour till it operates. At
the same time fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five drops
of laudanum may be given in a glass of peppermint
or simple cinnamon-water, to appease the irritation,
and prevent the vomiting, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>Acids have often a very happy effect in staying
the vomiting, and appeasing the other violent symptoms
of this disease. It will therefore be of use to
sharpen the patient’s drink with cream of tartar,
juice of lemon; or, when these cannot be obtained,
with vinegar.</p>

<p class='c008'>But it often happens that no liquid whatever will
stay on the stomach. In this case the patient must
take purging pills. I have generally found the
following answer very well: Take jalap in powder,
and vitriolated tartar, of each half a drachm, opium
one grain, Castile soap as much as will make the
mass fit for pills. These must be taken at one
dose, and if they do not operate in a few hours,
the dose may be repeated.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a stool cannot be procured by any of the above
means, it will be necessary to immerse the patient
in warm water up to the breast. I have often seen
this succeed when other means had been tried in
vain. The patient must continue in the water as
long as he can easily bear it without fainting, and
if one immersion has not the desired effect, it may
be repeated as soon as the patient’s strength and
spirits are recruited. It is more safe for him to go
frequently into the bath, than to continue too long
at a time; and it is often necessary to repeat it several
times before it has the desired effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has sometimes happened, after all other means
of procuring a stool had been tried to no purpose,
that this was brought about by immersing the patient’s
lower extremities in cold water, or making
him walk upon a wet pavement, and dashing his
legs and thighs with the cold water. This method,
when others fail, at least merits a trial. It is indeed
attended with some danger; but a doubtful
remedy is better than none.</p>

<p class='c008'>In desperate cases it is common to give quicksilver.
This may be given to the quantity of several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>ounces, or even a pound, but should not exceed
that<a id='r116'></a><a href='#f116' class='c010'><sup>[116]</sup></a>. When there is reason to suspect a mortification
of the guts, this medicine ought not to be
tried. In that case it cannot cure the patient, and
will only hasten his death. But when the obstruction
is occasioned by any cause that can be removed
by force, quicksilver is not only a proper medicine,
but the best that can be administered, as it is
the fittest body we know for making its way through
the intestinal canal.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disease proceed from a rupture, the patient
must be laid with his head very low, and the intestines
returned by gentle pressure with the hand.
If this, with fomentations and clysters, should not
succeed, recourse must be had to a surgical operation,
which may give the patient relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as would avoid this excruciating and dangerous
disease, must take care never to be too long
without a stool. Some who have died of it have
had several pounds of hard dry <i>fæces</i> taken out of
their guts. They should likewise beware of eating
too freely of sour or unripe fruits, or drinking
stale windy liquors, &#38;c. I have known it brought
on by living too much on baked fruits, which are
seldom good. It likewise proceeds frequently from
cold caught by wet clothes, &#38;c. but especially from
wet feet.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE COLIC.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The colic has a great resemblance to the two preceding
diseases, both in its symptoms and method
of cure. It is generally attended with costiveness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>and acute pain of the bowels; and requires diluting
diet, evacuations, fomentations, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colics are variously denominated according to
their causes, as the <i>flatulent</i>, the <i>bilious</i>, the <i>hysteric</i>,
the <i>nervous</i>, &#38;c. As each of these requires a particular
method of treatment, we shall point out
their most general symptoms, and the means to be
used for their relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>flatulent</i>, or wind-colic, is generally occasioned
by an indiscreet use of unripe fruits, meats
of hard digestion, windy vegetables, fermenting
liquors, and such like. It may likewise proceed
from an obstructed perspiration, or catching cold.
Delicate people, whose digestive powers are weak,
are most liable to this kind of colic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flatulent colic may either affect the stomach
or intestines. It is attended with a painful stretching
of the affected part. The patient feels a
rumbling in his guts, and is generally relieved by a
discharge of wind, either upwards or downwards.
The pain is seldom confined to any particular part,
as the vapour wanders from one division of the
bowels to another till it finds a vent.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease proceeds from windy liquor,
green fruit, sour herbs, or the like, the best medicine
on the first appearance of the symptoms is a
dram of brandy, gin, or any good spirits. The patient
should likewise sit with his feet upon a warm
hearth-stone, or apply warm bricks to them; and
warm cloths may be applied to his stomach and
bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is the only colic wherein ardent spirits, spiceries,
or any thing of a hot nature, may be ventured
upon. Nor indeed are they to be used here
unless at the very beginning, before any symptoms
of inflammation appear. We have reason to believe,
that a colic occasioned by wind or flatulent
food might always be cured by spirits and warm liquors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>if they were taken immediately upon perceiving
the first uneasiness; but when the pain has
continued for a considerable time, and there is reason
to fear an inflammation of the bowels is already
begun, all hot things are to be avoided as
poison, and the patient is to be treated in the same
manner as for the inflammation of the intestines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several kinds of food, as honey, eggs, &#38;c. occasion
colics in some particular constitutions. I
have generally found the best method of cure for
these was to drink plentifully of small diluting liquors,
as water-gruel, small posset, water with
toasted bread soaked in it, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colics which proceed from excess and indigestion
generally cure themselves by occasioning
vomiting or purging. These discharges are by no
means to be stopped, but promoted by drinking
plentifully of warm water, or weak posset. When
their violence is over, the patient may take a dose
of rhubarb, or any other gentle purge, to carry off
the dregs of his debauch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Colics which are occasioned by wet feet, or catching
cold, may generally be removed at the beginning,
by bathing the feet and legs in warm water,
and drinking such warm diluting liquors as will
promote the perspiration, as weak wine-whey, or
water-gruel, with a small quantity of spirits in
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those flatulent colics, which prevail so much
among country people, might generally be prevented
were they careful to change their clothes
when they get wet. They ought likewise to take a
dram, or to drink some warm liquor after eating
any kind of green trash. We do not mean to
recommend the practice of dram-drinking, but in
this case ardent spirits prove a real medicine, and
indeed the best that can be administered. A glass
of good peppermint water will have nearly the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>same effect as a glass of brandy, and in some cases is
rather to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>bilious</i> colic is attended with very acute pains
about the region of the navel. The patient complains
of great thirst, and is generally costive. He
vomits a hot, bitter, yellow-coloured bile, which
being discharged, seems to afford some relief, but is
quickly followed by the same violent pain as before.
As the distemper advances, the propensity to vomit
sometimes increases so as to become almost continual,
and the proper motion of the intestines is so
far perverted, that there are all the symptoms of
an impending iliac passion.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be young and strong, and the pulse
full and frequent, it will be proper to bleed, after
which clysters may be administered. Clear whey or
gruel, sharpened with the juice of lemon, or cream
of tartar, must be drank freely. Small chicken-broth,
with a little manna dissolved in it, or a slight
decoction of tamarinds, are likewise very proper,
or any other thin, acid, opening liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Besides bleeding and plentiful dilution, it will be
necessary to foment the belly with cloths dipped in
warm water, and if this should not succeed, the patient
must be immersed up to the breast in warm
water.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the bilious colic the vomiting is often very
difficult to restrain. When this happens, the patient
may drink a decoction of toasted bread, or an infusion
of garden-mint in boiling water. Should these
not have the desired effect, the saline draught, with
a few drops of laudanum in it, may be given, and
repeated according to the urgency of the symptoms.
A small quantity of Venice treacle may be spread in
form of a cataplasm, and applied to the pit of the
stomach. Clysters, with a proper quantity of Venice
treacle or liquid laudanum in them, may likewise
be frequently administered.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>Such as are liable to frequent returns of the bilious
colic should use flesh sparingly, and live chiefly
upon a light vegetable diet. They should likewise
take frequently a dose of cream of tartar with tamarinds,
or any other cool acid purge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>hysteric</i> colic bears a great resemblance to the
bilious. It is attended with acute pains about the
region of the stomach, vomiting, &#38;c. But what
the patient vomits in this case is commonly of a
greenish colour. There is a great sinking of the
spirits, with dejection of mind and difficulty of
breathing, which are the characteristic symptoms of
this disorder. Sometimes it is accompanied with
the jaundice, but this generally goes off of its own
accord in a few days.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this colic all evacuations, as bleeding, purging,
vomiting, &#38;c. do hurt. Every thing that
weakens the patient, or sinks the spirits, is to be
avoided. If however the vomiting should prove
violent, lukewarm water, or small posset, may be
drank to cleanse the stomach. Afterwards the patient
may take fifteen, twenty, or twenty-five drops
of liquid laudanum in a glass of cinnamon water.
This may be repeated every ten or twelve hours till
the symptoms abate.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient may likewise take four or five of the
fœtid pills every six hours, and drink a cup of penny-royal
tea after them. If asafœtida should prove
disagreeable, which is sometimes the case, a tea-spoonful
of the tincture of castor in a cup of penny-royal
tea, or thirty or forty drops of the balsam of
Peru dropped upon a bit of loaf-sugar, may be
taken in its stead. The anti-hysteric plaster may
also be used, which has often a good effect<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c010'><sup>[117]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>nervous</i> colic prevails among miners, smelters
of lead, plumbers, the manufacturers of white
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>lead, &#38;c. It is very common in the cyder counties
of England, and is supposed to be occasioned
by the leaden vessels used in preparing that liquor.
It is likewise a frequent disease in the West Indies,
where it is termed the dry belly-ache.</p>

<p class='c008'>No disease of the bowels is attended with more
excruciating pain than this. Nor is it soon at an
end. I have known it continue eight or ten days
with very little intermission, the body all the while
continuing bound in spite of medicine, yet at length
yield, and the patient recover<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c010'><sup>[118]</sup></a>. It generally however
leaves the patient weak, and often ends in a
palsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general treatment of this disease is so nearly
the same with that of the iliac passion, or inflammation
of the guts, that we shall not insist upon it.
The body is to be opened by mild purgatives given
in small doses, and frequently repeated, and their
operation must be assisted by soft oily clysters, fomentations,
&#38;c. The castor oil is reckoned peculiarly
proper in this disease. It may both be mixed
with the clysters and given by the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Barbadoes tar is said to be an efficacious
medicine in this complaint. It may be taken to the
quantity of two drachms three times a day, or
oftner if the stomach will bear it. This tar, mixed
with an equal quantity of strong rum, is likewise
proper for rubbing the spine, in case any tingling,
or other symptoms of a palsy, are felt. When the
tar cannot be obtained, the back may be rubbed
with strong spirits, or a little oil of nutmegs or of
rosemary.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>If the patient remains weak and languid after
this disease, he must take exercise on horseback,
and use an infusion of the Peruvian bark in wine.
When the disease ends in a palsy, the Bath-waters
are found to be extremely proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>To avoid this kind of colic, people must shun all
sour fruits, acids, and austere liquors, &#38;c. Those
who work in lead ought never to go to their business
fasting, and their food should be oily or fat.
They may take a glass of sallad oil, with a little
brandy or rum every morning, but should never
take spirits alone. Liquid aliment is best for them;
as fat broths, &#38;c. but low living is bad. They
should frequently go a little out of the tainted air;
and should never suffer themselves to be costive. In
the West Indies, and on the coast of Guinea, it has
been found of great use, for preventing this colic,
to wear a piece of flannel round the waist, and to
drink an infusion of ginger by way of tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sundry other kinds of this disease might be mentioned,
but too many distinctions would tend only
to perplex the reader. Those already mentioned are
the most material, and should indeed be attended to,
as their treatment is very different. But even persons
who are not in a condition to distinguish very
accurately in these matters, may nevertheless be of
great service to patients in colics of every kind, by
only observing the following general rules, <i>viz.</i> To
bathe the feet and legs in warm water; to apply
bladders filled with warm water, or cloths dipped
in it, to the stomach and bowels; to make the
patient drink freely of diluting mucilaginous liquors;
and to give him an emollient clyster every
two or three hours. Should these not succeed, the
patient ought to be immersed in warm water.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>INFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>CAUSES.——This disease may proceed from
any of those causes which produce an inflammatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>fever. It may likewise be occasioned by wounds or
bruises of the kidneys; small stones or gravel lodging
within them; by strong diuretic medicines; as
spirits of turpentine, tincture of cantharides, &#38;c.
Violent motion, as hard riding or walking, especially
in hot weather, or whatever drives the blood
too forcibly into the kidneys, may occasion this
malady. It may likewise proceed from lying too
soft, too much on the back, involuntary contractions,
or spasms, in the urinary vessels, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——There is a sharp pain about
the region of the kidneys, with some degree of fever,
and a stupor or dull pain in the thigh of the
affected side. The urine is at first clear, and afterwards
of a reddish colour; but in the worst kind of
the disease it generally continues pale, is passed with
difficulty, and commonly in small quantities at a
time. The patient feels great uneasiness when he
endeavours to walk or sit upright. He lies with
most ease on the affected side, and has generally a
nausea or vomiting, resembling that which happens
in the colic.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease however may be distinguished from
the colic by the pain being seated farther back, and
by the difficulty of passing urine with which it is
constantly attended.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Every thing of a heating or
stimulating nature is to be avoided. The food must
be thin and light; as panado, small broths, with
mild vegetables, and the like. Emollient and thin
liquors must be plentifully drank; as clear whey, or
balm-tea sweetened with honey, decoctions of
marsh-mallow roots, with barley and liquorice,
&#38;c. The patient, notwithstanding the vomiting,
must constantly keep sipping small quantities of
these or other diluting liquors. Nothing so safely
and certainly abates the inflammation, and expels
the obstructing cause, as copious dilution. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>patient must be kept easy, quiet, and free from
cold, as long as any symptoms of inflammation remain.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Bleeding is generally necessary,
especially at the beginning. Ten or twelve
ounces may be let from the arm or foot with a lancet,
and if the pain and inflammation continue, the
operation may be repeated in twenty-four hours, especially
if the patient be of a full habit. Leeches
may likewise be applied to the hæmorrhoidal veins,
as a discharge from these will greatly relieve the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cloths dipped in warm water, or bladders filled
with it, must be applied as near as possible to the
part affected, and renewed as they grow cool. If
the bladders be filled with a decoction of mallows
and camomile flowers, to which a little saffron is
added, and mixed with about a third part of new
milk, it will be still more beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emollient clysters ought frequently to be administered;
and if these do not open the body, a little
salt and honey or manna may be added to them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same course is to be followed where gravel or
stone is lodged in the kidney, but when the gravel
or stone is separated from the kidney, and lodges in
the Ureter<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c010'><sup>[119]</sup></a>, it will be proper, besides the fomentations,
to rub the small of the back with sweet oil,
and to give gentle diuretics; as juniper-water sweetened
with the syrup of marsh-mallows: a tea-spoonful
of the sweet spirits of nitre, with a few
drops of laudanum, may now and then be put in a
cup of the patient’s drink. He ought likewise to
take exercise on horseback, or in a carriage, if he
be able to bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>When the disease is protracted beyond the seventh
or eighth day, and the patient complains of a stupor
and heaviness of the part, has frequent returns of
chillness, shivering, &#38;c. there is reason to suspect
that matter is forming in the kidney, and that an
abscess will ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>When matter in the urine shews that an ulcer is
already formed in the kidney, the patient must be
careful to abstain from all acrid, sour, and salted provisions;
and to live chiefly upon mild mucilaginous
herbs and fruits, together with the broth of young
animals, made with barley, and common pot-herbs,
&#38;c. His drink may be whey, and butter-milk
that is not sour. The latter is by some reckoned
a specific remedy in ulcers of the kidneys. To answer
this character, however, it must be drank for
a considerable time. Chalybeate waters have likewise
been found beneficial in this disease. This
medicine is easily obtained, as it is found in every
part of Great Britain. It must likewise be used for
a considerable time, in order to produce any salutary
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are liable to frequent returns of inflammation,
or obstructions of the kidneys, must abstain
from wines, especially such as abound with tartar;
and their food ought to be light, and of easy digestion.
They should use moderate exercise, and
should not lie too hot, nor too much on their back.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>INFLAMMATION OF THE BLADDER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The inflammation of the bladder proceeds, in a
great measure, from the same causes as that of the
kidneys. It is known by an acute pain towards
the bottom of the belly, and difficulty of passing
urine, with some degree of fever, a constant inclination
to go to stool, and a perpetual desire to
make water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>This disease must be treated on the same principles
as the one immediately preceding. The diet
must be light and thin, and the drink of a cooling
nature. Bleeding is very proper at the beginning,
and in robust constitutions it will often be necessary
to repeat it. The lower part of the belly should be
fomented with warm water, or a decoction of mild
vegetables; and emollient clysters ought frequently
to be administered, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should abstain from every thing that
is of a hot, acrid, and stimulating quality, and
should live entirely upon small broths, gruels, or
mild vegetables.</p>

<p class='c008'>A stoppage of urine may proceed from other
causes besides an inflammation of the bladder; as a
swelling of the hæmorrhoidal veins, hard <i>fæces</i>
lodged in the <i>rectum</i>; a stone in the bladder; excrescences
in the urinary passages, a palsy of the bladder,
hysteric affections, &#38;c. Each of these requires
a particular treatment, which does not fall under
our present consideration. We shall only observe,
that in all of them mild and gentle applications are
the safest, as strong diuretic medicines, or things of
an irritating nature, generally increase the danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have known some persons kill themselves by introducing
probes into the urinary passages, to remove,
as they thought, somewhat that obstructed
the discharge of urine, and others bring on a violent
inflammation of the bladder, by using strong diuretics,
as oil of turpentine, &#38;c. for that purpose.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The liver is less subject to inflammation than most
of the other viscera, as in it the circulation is slower;
but when an inflammation does happen, it is
with difficulty removed, and often ends in a suppuration
or scirrhus.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>CAUSES.——Besides the common causes of inflammation,
we may here reckon the following, <i>viz.</i>
excessive fatness, a scirrhus of the liver itself, violent
shocks from strong vomits when the liver was
before unsound, an adust or atrabiliarian state of
the blood, any thing that suddenly cools the liver
after it has been greatly heated, stones obstructing
the course of the bile, drinking strong wines and
spirituous liquors, using hot spicy aliment, obstinate
hypochondriacal affections, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——This disease is known by a
painful tension of the right side under the false ribs,
attended with some degree of fever, a sense of
weight, or fulness of the part, difficulty of breathing,
loathing of food, great thirst, with a pale or
yellowish colour of the skin and eyes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>symptoms</i> here are various, according to the
degree of inflammation, and likewise according to
the particular part of the liver where the inflammation
happens. Sometimes the pain is so inconsiderable,
that an inflammation is not so much as suspected;
but when it happens in the upper or convex
part of the liver, the pain is more acute, the pulse
quicker, and the patient is often troubled with a
dry cough, a hiccup, and a pain extending to the
shoulder, with difficulty of lying on the left side, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease may be distinguished from the pleurisy
by the pain being less violent, seated under the
false ribs, the pulse not so hard, and by the difficulty
of lying on the left side. It may be distinguished
from the hysteric and hypochondriac disorders
by the degree of fever with which it is always
attended.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease, if properly treated, is seldom mortal.
A constant hiccuping, violent fever, and excessive
thirst, are bad symptoms. If it ends in a
suppuration, and the matter cannot be discharged
outwardly, the danger is great. When the scirrhus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>of the liver ensues, the patient, if he observes a
proper regimen, may nevertheless live a number of
years tolerably easy; but if he indulge in animal
food and strong liquors, or take medicines of an
acrid or irritating nature, the scirrhus will be converted
into a cancer, which must infallibly prove
fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The same regimen is to be observed
in this as in other inflammatory disorders.
All hot things are to be carefully avoided, and cool
diluting liquors, as whey, barley-water, &#38;c. drank
freely. The food must be light and thin, and the
body, as well as the mind, kept easy and quiet.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Bleeding is proper at the beginning
of this disease, and it will often be necessary,
even though the pulse should not feel hard, to repeat
it. All violent purgatives are to be avoided; the
body however must be kept gently open. A decoction
of tamarinds, with a little honey or manna,
will answer this purpose very well. The side affected
must be fomented in the manner directed in the
foregoing diseases. Mild laxative clysters should
be frequently administered; and, if the pain should
notwithstanding continue violent, a blistering plaster
may be applied over the part affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicines which promote the secretion of urine
have a very good effect here. For this purpose half
a drachm of purified nitre, or a tea-spoonful of the
sweet spirits of nitre, may be taken in a cup of the
patient’s drink three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>When there is an inclination to sweat, it ought
to be promoted, but not by warm sudorifics. The
only thing to be used for that purpose is plenty of
diluting liquors drank about the warmth of the human
blood. Indeed the patient in this case, as well
as in all other topical inflammations, ought to drink
nothing that is colder than the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>If the stools should be loose, and even streaked
with blood, no means must be used to stop them,
unless they be so frequent as to weaken the patient.
Loose stools often prove critical, and carry off the
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>If an abscess or imposthume is formed in the liver,
all methods should be tried to make it break and
discharge itself outwardly, as fomentations, the application
of poultices, ripening cataplasms, &#38;c.
Sometimes indeed the matter of an abscess comes
away in the urine, and sometimes it is discharged
by stool, but these are efforts of Nature which no
means can promote. When the abscess bursts into
the cavity of the <i>abdomen</i> at large, death must ensue;
nor will the event be more favourable when the abscess
is opened by an incision, unless in cases where
the liver adheres to the <i>peritonæum</i>, so as to form a
bag for the matter, and prevent it from falling into
the cavity of the <i>abdomen</i>; in which case opening
the abscess by a sufficiently large incision will probably
save the patient’s life<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c010'><sup>[120]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the disorder, in spite of all endeavours to the
contrary, should end in a scirrhus, the patient must
be careful to regulate his diet, &#38;c. in such a manner
as not to aggravate the disease. He must not indulge
in flesh, fish, strong liquors, or any highly
seasoned or salted provisions; but should, for the
most part, live on mild vegetables, as fruits and
roots; taking gentle exercise, and drinking whey,
barley-water, or butter-milk. If he takes any thing
stronger, it should be fine mild ale, which is less
heating than wines or spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall take no notice of inflammations of the
other viscera. They must in general be treated upon
the same principles as those already mentioned.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>The chief rule with respect to all of them, is to let
blood, to avoid every thing that is strong, or of a
heating nature, to apply warm fomentations to the
part affected, and to cause the patient to drink a
sufficient quantity of warm diluting liquors.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE CHOLERA MORBUS, AND OTHER EXCESSIVE DISCHARGES FROM THE STOMACH AND BOWELS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The <i>cholera morbus</i> is a violent purging and vomiting,
attended with gripes, sickness, and a
constant desire to go to stool. It comes on suddenly,
and is most common in autumn. There is
hardly any disease that kills more quickly than this,
when proper means are not used in due time for
removing it.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——It is occasioned by a redundancy
and putrid acrimony of the bile; cold; food that
easily turns rancid or sour on the stomach; as butter,
bacon, sweetmeats, cucumbers, melons, cherries,
and other cold fruits<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c010'><sup>[121]</sup></a>. It is sometimes the
effect of strong acrid purges or vomits, or of poisonous
substances taken into the stomach. It may
likewise proceed from violent passions or affections
of the mind; as fear, anger, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——It is generally preceded by a
<i>cardialgia</i>, or heart-burn, sour belchings, and flatulencies,
with pain of the stomach and intestines.
To these succeed excessive vomiting, and purging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>of green, yellow, or blackish-coloured bile, with a
distension of the stomach, and violent griping pains.
There is likewise a great thirst, with a very quick
unequal pulse, and often a fixed acute pain about
the region of the navel. As the disease advances,
the pulse often sinks low as to become quite imperceptible,
the extremities grow cold, or cramped,
and are often covered with a clammy sweat, the
urine is obstructed, and there is a palpitation of the
heart. Violent hiccuping, fainting, and convulsions,
are the signs of approaching death.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——At the beginning of this disease
the efforts of Nature to expel the offending
cause should be assisted, by promoting the purging
and vomiting. For this purpose the patient must
drink freely of diluting liquors; as whey, butter-milk,
warm water, thin water-gruel, small posset,
or, what is perhaps preferable to any of them, very
weak chicken broth. This should not only be
drank plentifully to promote the vomiting, but a
clyster of it given every hour in order to promote
the purging.</p>

<p class='c008'>After these evacuations have been continued for
some time, a decoction of toasted oat-bread may
be drank to stop the vomiting. The bread should
be toasted till it is of a brown colour, and afterwards
boiled in spring water. If oat-bread cannot
be had, wheat-bread, or oatmeal well toasted,
may be used in its stead. If this does not put a stop
to the vomiting, two table-spoonfuls of the saline
julep, with ten drops of laudanum, may be taken
every hour till it ceases.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vomiting and purging however ought never
to be stopped too soon. As long as these discharges
do not weaken the patient, they are salutary,
and may be allowed to go on, or rather ought
to be promoted. But when the patient is weakened
by the evacuations, which may be known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>from the sinking of his pulse, &#38;c. recourse must
immediately be had to opiates, as recommended
above; to which may be added strong wines, with
spirituous cinnamon-waters, and other generous
cordials. Warm negus, or strong wine-whey, will
likewise be necessary to support the patient’s spirits,
and promote the perspiration. His legs should be
bathed in warm water, and afterwards rubbed with
flannel cloths, or wrapped in warm blankets, and
warm bricks applied to the soles of his feet. Flannels
wrung out of warm spirituous fomentations
should likewise be applied to the region of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the violence of the disease is over, to prevent
a relapse, it will be necessary for some time
to continue the use of small doses of laudanum.
Ten or twelve drops may be taken in a glass of
wine, at least twice a day, for eight or ten days.
The patient’s food ought to be nourishing, but
taken in small quantities, and he should use moderate
exercise. As the stomach and intestines are
generally much weakened, an infusion of the bark,
or other bitters, in small wine, sharpened with the
elixir of vitriol, may be drank for some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though physicians are seldom called in due time
in this disease, they ought not to despair of relieving
the patient even in the most desperate circumstances.
Of this I lately saw a very striking
proof in an old man and his son, who had been
both seized with it about the middle of the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>I did not see them till next morning, when they
had much more the appearance of dead than of
living men. No pulse could be felt; the extremities
were cold and rigid; the countenance was
ghastly, and the strength almost quite exhausted.
Yet from this deplorable condition they were both
recovered by the use of opiates and cordial medicines.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF A DIARRHŒA, or LOOSENESS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>A looseness, in many cases, is not to be considered
as a disease, but rather as a salutary evacuation.
It ought therefore never to be stopped,
unless when it continues too long, or evidently
weakens the patient. As this however sometimes
happens, we shall point out the most common
causes of a looseness, with the proper method of
treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a looseness is occasioned by catching cold,
or an obstructed perspiration, the patient ought to
keep warm, to drink freely of weak diluting liquors,
to bathe his feet and legs frequently in lukewarm
water, to wear flannel next his skin, and to
take every other method to restore the perspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a looseness which proceeds from excess or repletion,
a vomit is the proper medicine. Vomits
not only cleanse the stomach, but promote all the
secretions, which renders them of great importance
in carrying off a debauch. Half a drachm of
ipecacuanha in powder will answer this purpose
very well. A day or two after the vomit, the
same quantity of rhubarb may be taken, and repeated
two or three times, if the looseness continues.
The patient ought to live upon light vegetable
food of easy digestion, and to drink whey,
thin gruel, or barley-water.</p>

<p class='c008'>A looseness, occasioned by the obstruction of any
customary evacuation, generally requires bleeding.
If that does not succeed, other evacuations may be
substituted in the room of those which are obstructed.
At the same time, every method is to be
taken to restore the usual discharges, as not only
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>the cure of the disease, but the patient’s life, may
depend on this.</p>

<p class='c008'>A periodical looseness ought never to be stopped.
It is always an effort of Nature to carry off some
offending matter, which, if retained in the body,
might have fatal effects. Children are very liable
to this kind of looseness, especially while teething.
It is however so far from being hurtful to them,
that such children generally get their teeth with
least trouble. If these loose stools should at any
time prove sour or griping, a tea-spoonful of magnesia
alba, with four or five grains of rhubarb, may
be given to the child in a little panado, or any other
food. This, if repeated three or four times, will
generally correct the acidity, and carry off the
griping stools.</p>

<p class='c008'>A diarrhœa, or looseness, which proceeds from
violent passions or affections of the mind, must be
treated with the greatest caution. Vomits in this
case are highly improper. Nor are purges safe,
unless they be very mild, and given in small quantities.
Opiates, and other antispasmodic medicines,
are most proper. Ten or twelve drops of liquid
laudanum may be taken in a cup of valerian or
penny-royal tea every eight or ten hours, till the
symptoms abate. Ease, cheerfulness, and tranquillity
of mind, are here of the greatest importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a looseness proceeds from acrid or poisonous
substances taken into the stomach, the patient
must drink large quantities of diluting liquors,
with oil or fat broths, to promote vomiting and
purging. Afterwards, if there be reason to suspect
that the bowels are inflamed, bleeding will be
necessary. Small doses of laudanum may likewise
be taken to remove their irritation.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the gout, repelled from the extremities,
occasions a looseness, it ought to be promoted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>gentle doses of rhubarb, or other mild purgatives.
The gouty matter is likewise to be solicited towards
the extremities by warm fomentations, cataplasms,
&#38;c. The perspiration ought at the same time to
be promoted by warm diluting liquors; as wine-whey,
with spirits of hartshorn, or a few drops of
liquid laudanum, in it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a looseness proceeds from worms, which
may be known from the sliminess of the stools,
mixed with pieces of decayed worms, &#38;c. medicines
must be given to kill and carry off these vermin,
as the powder of tin with purges of rhubarb
and calomel. Afterwards lime-water, either alone,
or with a small quantity of rhubarb infused, will
be proper to strengthen the bowels, and prevent
the new generation of worms.</p>

<p class='c008'>A looseness is often occasioned by drinking bad
water. When this is the case, the disease generally
proves epidemical. When there is reason to
believe that this or any other disease proceeds from
the use of unwholesome water, it ought immediately
to be changed, or, if that cannot be done, it
may be corrected by mixing with it quicklime,
chalk, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>In people whose stomachs are weak, violent exercise
immediately after eating will occasion a looseness.
Though the cure of this is obvious, yet it
will be proper, besides avoiding violent exercise,
to use such medicines as tend to brace and strengthen
the stomach, as infusions of the bark, with other
bitter and astringent ingredients, in white-wine.
Such persons ought likewise to take frequently a
glass or two of old red port, or good claret.</p>

<p class='c008'>From whatever cause a looseness proceeds, when
it is found necessary to check it, the diet ought to
consist of rice boiled with milk, and flavoured with
cinnamon; rice-jelly; sago, with red port; and
the lighter sorts of flesh-meat roasted. The drink
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>may be thin water-gruel, rice-water, or weak broth
made from lean veal, or with a sheep’s head, as being
more gelatinous than mutton, beef, or chicken-broth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who, from a peculiar weakness, or too
great an irritability of the bowels, are liable to
frequent returns of this disease, should live temperately,
avoiding crude summer fruits, all unwholesome
food, and meats of hard digestion. They
ought likewise to beware of cold, moisture, or
whatever may obstruct the perspiration, and should
wear flannel next their skin. All violent passions,
as fear, anger, &#38;c. are likewise carefully to be
guarded against.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF VOMITING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Vomiting may proceed from various causes; as
excess in eating and drinking; foulness of the stomach;
the acrimony of the aliments; a translation
of the morbific matter of ulcers, of the gout, the
erysipelas, or other diseases, to the stomach. It
may likewise proceed from a looseness having been
too suddenly stopped; from the stoppage of any
customary evacuation, as the bleeding piles, the
<i>menses</i>, &#38;c. from a weakness of the stomach, the
colic, the iliac passion, a rupture, a fit of the gravel,
worms; or from any kind of poison taken into
the stomach. It is an usual symptom of injuries
done to the brain; as contusions, compressions, &#38;c.
It is likewise a symptom of wounds or inflammations
of the diaphragm, intestines, spleen, liver,
kidneys, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vomiting may be occasioned by unusual motions;
as sailing, being drawn backwards in a cart
or coach, &#38;c. It may likewise be excited by violent
passions, or by the idea of nauseous or disagreeable
objects, especially of such things as have formerly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>produced vomiting. Sometimes it proceeds
from a regurgitation of the bile into the stomach:
in this case, what the patient vomits is generally
of a yellow or greenish colour, and has a bitter
taste. Persons who are subject to nervous affections
are often suddenly seized with violent fits of
vomiting. Lastly, vomiting is a common symptom
of pregnancy. In this case it generally comes
on about two weeks after the stoppage of the
<i>menses</i>, and continues during the first three or four
months.</p>

<p class='c008'>When vomiting proceeds from a foul stomach or
indigestion, it is not to be considered as a disease,
but as the cure of a disease. It ought therefore to
be promoted by drinking lukewarm water, or thin
gruel. If this does not put a stop to the vomiting,
a dose of ipecacuanha may be taken, and worked
off with weak camomile-tea.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the retrocession of the gout, or the obstruction
of customary evacuations, occasion vomiting,
all means must be used to restore these discharges;
or, if that cannot be effected, their place
must be supplied by others, as bleeding, purging,
bathing the extremities in warm water, opening
issues, setons, perpetual blisters, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When vomiting is the effect of pregnancy, it
may generally be mitigated by bleeding, and keeping
the body gently open. The bleeding however
ought to be in small quantities at a time, and the
purgatives should be of the mildest kind, as figs,
stewed prunes, manna, or senna. Pregnant women
are most apt to vomit in the morning, immediately
after getting out of bed, which is owing
partly to the change of posture, but more to the
emptiness of the stomach. It may generally be
prevented by taking a dish of coffee, tea, or some
light breakfast in bed. Pregnant women who are afflicted
with vomiting ought to be kept easy both in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>body and mind. They should neither allow their
stomachs to be quite empty, nor should they eat
much at once. Cold water is a very proper drink
in this case; if the stomach be weak, a little brandy
may be added to it. If the spirits are low, and
the person apt to faint, a spoonful of cinnamon-water,
with a little marmalade of quinces or oranges,
may be taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>If vomiting proceeds from weakness of the stomach,
bitters will be of service. Peruvian bark
infused in wine or brandy, with as much rhubarb as
will keep the body gently open, is an excellent medicine
in this case. The elixir of vitriol is also a
good medicine. It may be taken in the dose of
fifteen or twenty drops, twice or thrice a day, in a
glass of wine or water. Habitual vomitings are
sometimes alleviated by making oysters a principal
part of diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>A vomiting, which proceeds from acidities in the
stomach, is relieved by alkaline purges. The best
medicine of this kind is the magnesia alba, a tea-spoonful
of which may be taken in a dish of tea or
a little milk, three or four times a day, or oftener
if necessary, to keep the body open.</p>

<p class='c008'>When vomiting proceeds from violent passions,
or affections of the mind, all evacuants must be
carefully avoided, especially vomits. These are
exceedingly dangerous. The patient in this case
ought to be kept perfectly easy and quiet, to have
the mind soothed, and to take some gentle cordial,
as negus, or a little brandy and water, to which a
few drops of laudanum may occasionally be
added.</p>

<p class='c008'>When vomiting proceeds from spasmodic affections
of the stomach, musk, castor, and other
antispasmodic medicines, are of use. Warm and
aromatic plasters have likewise a good effect. The
stomach plaster of the London or Edinburgh dispensatory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_318'>318</span>may be applied to the pit of the stomach,
or a plaster of <i>theriaca</i>, which will answer rather
better. Aromatic medicines may likewise be taken
inwardly, as cinnamon or mint-tea, wine with
spiceries boiled in it, &#38;c. The region of the stomach
may be rubbed with æther, or, if that cannot
be had, with strong brandy, or other spirits.
The belly should be fomented with warm water,
or the patient immersed up to the breast in a warm
bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have always found the saline draughts taken in
the act of effervescence, of singular use in stopping
a vomiting, from whatever cause it proceeded.
These may be prepared by dissolving a drachm of
the salt of tartar in an ounce and half of fresh lemon-juice,
and adding to it an ounce of peppermint-water,
the same quantity of simple cinnamon-water,
and a little white sugar. This draught
must be swallowed before the effervescence is quite
over, and may be repeated every two hours, or
oftner, if the vomiting be violent. A violent
vomiting has sometimes been stopped by cupping
on the region of the stomach after all other means
had failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the least motion will often bring on the vomiting
again, even after it has been stopped, the
patient must avoid all manner of action. The diet
must be so regulated as to sit easy upon the stomach,
and nothing should be taken that is hard of digestion.
We do not however mean that the patient
should live entirely upon slops. Solid food,
in this case, often sits easier on the stomach than
liquids.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE DIABETES, AND OTHER DISORDERS OF THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The diabetes is a frequent and excessive discharge
of urine. It is seldom to be met with
among young people; but often attacks persons in
the decline of life, especially those who follow the
more violent employments, or have been hard
drinkers in their youth.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——A diabetes is often the consequence
of acute diseases, as fevers, fluxes, &#38;c.
where the patient has suffered by excessive evacuations;
it may also be occasioned by great fatigue,
as riding long journies upon a hard-trotting horse,
carrying heavy burdens, running, &#38;c. It may be
brought on by hard drinking, or the use of strong
stimulating diuretic medicines, as tincture of cantharides,
spirits of turpentine, and such like. It
is often the effect of drinking too great quantities
of mineral waters. Many imagine that these will
do them no service unless they be drank in great
quantities, by which mistake it often happens that
they occasion worse diseases than those they were
intended to cure. In a word, this disease may either
proceed from too great a laxity of the organs
which secrete the urine, from something that stimulates
the kidneys too much, or from a thin dissolved
state of the blood, which makes too great a quantity
of it run off by the urinary passages.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——In a diabetes, the urine generally
exceeds in quantity all the liquid food which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>the patient takes. It is thin and pale, of a sweetish
taste, and an agreeable smell. The patient has
a continual thirst, with some degree of fever; his
mouth is dry, and he spits frequently a frothy
spittle. The strength fails, the appetite decays,
and the flesh wastes away till the patient is reduced
to skin and bone. There is a heat of the bowels;
and frequently the loins, testicles, and feet are
swelled.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease may generally be cured at the beginning;
but after it has continued long, the cure
becomes very difficult. In drunkards, and very
old people, a perfect cure is not to be expected.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Every thing that stimulates the
urinary passages, or tends to relax the habit, must
be avoided. For this reason the patient should live
chiefly on solid food. His thirst may be quenched
with acids; as sorrel, juice of lemon, or vinegar.
The mucilaginous vegetables, as rice, sago, and
salop, with milk, are the most proper food. Of
animal substances, shell-fish are to be preferred;
as oysters, crabs, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drink may be Bristol-water. When that
cannot be obtained, lime-water, in which a due
proportion of oak bark has been macerated, may
be used. The white decoction<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c010'><sup>[122]</sup></a>, with isinglass dissolved
in it, is likewise a very proper drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient ought daily to take exercise, but it
should be so gentle as not to fatigue him. He
should lie upon a hard bed or matrass. Nothing
hurts the kidneys more than lying too soft. A
warm dry air, the use of the flesh-brush, and every
thing that promotes perspiration, is of service. For
this reason the patient ought to wear flannel next
his skin. A large strengthening plaster may be applied
to the back; or, what will answer better, a
great part of the body may be wrapt in plaster.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>MEDICINE.——Gentle purges, if the patient
be not too much weakened by the disease, have a
good effect. They may consist of rhubarb, with
cardamum seeds, or any other spiceries, infused in
wine, and may be taken in such quantities as to
keep the body gently open.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient must next have recourse to astringents
and corroborants. Half a drachm of powder
made of equal parts of allum and the inspissated
juice commonly called <i>Terra Japonica</i>, may be
taken four times a-day, or oftner, if the stomach
will bear it. The allum must first be melted in a
crucible; afterwards they may both be pounded
together. Along with every dose of this powder
the patient may take a tea-cupful of the tincture of
roses<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c010'><sup>[123]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient’s stomach cannot bear the allum in
substance, whey may be made of it, and taken in
the dose of a tea-cupful three or four times a-day.
The allum-whey is prepared by boiling two English
quarts of milk over a slow fire, with three
drachms of allum, till the curd separates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opiates are of service in this disease, even though
the patient rests well. They take off spasm and
irritation, and at the same time lessen the force of
the circulation. Ten or twelve drops of liquid
laudanum may be taken in a cup of the patient’s
drink three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best corroborants which we know, are the
Peruvian bark and wine. A drachm of bark may
be taken in a glass of red port or claret three times
a-day. The medicine will be both more efficacious
and less disagreeable, if fifteen or twenty drops
of the acid elixir of vitriol be added to each dose.
Such as cannot take the bark in substance may use
the decoction, mixed with an equal quantity of red
wine, and sharpened as above.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>There is a disease incident to labouring people in
the decline of life, called <i>an <em class='gesperrt'>INCONTINENCY</em>
of urine</i>. But this is very different
from a diabetes, as the water passes off involuntarily
by drops, and does not exceed the usual
quantity. This disease is rather troublesome than
dangerous. It is owing to a relaxation of the
sphincter of the bladder, and is often the effect of
a palsy. Sometimes it proceeds from hurts, or
injuries occasioned by blows, bruises, preternatural
labours, &#38;c. Sometimes it is the effect of a fever.
It may likewise be occasioned by a long use
of strong diuretics, or of stimulating medicines injected
into the bladder.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease may be mitigated by the use of
astringent and corroborating medicines, such as
have been mentioned above; but we do not remember
ever to have seen it cured.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an incontinency of urine, from whatever cause,
a piece of sponge ought to be worn, or a bladder
applied in such a manner as to prevent the urine
from galling and excoriating the parts.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF A SUPPRESSION OF URINE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>It has already been observed, that a suppression
of urine may proceed from various causes; as an inflammation
of the kidneys, or bladder; small stones
or gravel lodging in the urinary passages, hard
<i>fæces</i> lying in the <i>rectum</i>, pregnancy, a spasm or
contraction of the neck of the bladder, clotted blood
in the bladder itself, a swelling of the hæmorrhoidal
veins, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of these cases require the catheter, both to
remove the obstructing matter, and to draw off the
urine; but as this instrument can only be managed
with safety by persons skilled in surgery, we shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>say nothing further of its use. A bougee may be
used by any cautious hand, and will often succeed
better than the catheter.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would chiefly recommend, in all obstructions
of urine, fomentations and evacuants. Bleeding,
as far as the patient’s strength will permit, is necessary,
especially where there are symptoms of topical
inflammation. Bleeding in this case not only
abates the fever, by lessening the force of the circulation,
but, by relaxing the solids, it takes off
the spasm or stricture upon the vessels which occasioned
the obstruction.</p>

<p class='c008'>After bleeding, fomentations must be used.
These may either consist of warm water alone, or of
decoctions of mild vegetables; as mallows, camomile-flowers,
&#38;c. Cloths dipped in these may either
be applied to the part affected, or a large bladder
filled with the decoction may be kept continually
upon it. Some put the herbs themselves
into a flannel bag, and apply them to the part,
which is far from being a bad method. These
continue longer warm than cloths dipped in the decoction,
and at the same time keep the part equally
moist.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all obstructions of urine, the body ought to
be kept open. This is not however to be attempted
by strong purgatives, but by emollient clysters, or
gentle infusions of senna and manna. Clysters in
this case not only open the body, but answer the
purpose of an internal fomentation, and greatly assist
in removing the spasms of the bladder and parts
adjacent.</p>

<p class='c008'>The food must be light, and taken in small quantities.
The drink may be weak broth, or decoctions
and infusions of mucilaginous vegetables, as
marsh-mallow roots, lime-tree buds, &#38;c. A tea-spoonful
of the sweet spirits of nitre, or a drachm
of Castile soap, may be frequently put into the patient’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>drink; and, if there be no inflammation, he
may drink small gin-punch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons subject to a suppression of urine ought
to live very temperate. Their diet should be light,
and their liquor diluting. They should avoid all
acids and austere wines, should take sufficient exercise,
lie hard, and avoid study and sedentary occupations.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE GRAVEL AND STONE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When small stones are lodged in the kidneys, or
discharged along with the urine, the patient is said
to be afflicted with the gravel. If one of these
stones happens to make a lodgment in the bladder
for some time, it accumulates fresh matter, and at
length becomes too large to pass off with the urine.
In this case the patient is said to have the stone.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The stone and gravel may be
occasioned by high living; the use of strong astringent
wines; a sedentary life; lying too hot, soft,
or too much on the back; the constant use of water
impregnated with earthy or stony particles; aliments
of an astringent or windy nature, &#38;c. It
may likewise proceed from an hereditary disposition.
Persons in the decline of life, and those who have
been much afflicted with the gout or rheumatism,
are most liable to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——Small stones or gravel in the
kidneys occasion pain in the loins; sickness; vomiting;
and sometimes bloody urine. When the
stone descends into the <i>ureter</i>, and is too large to
pass along with ease, all the above symptoms are
increased; the pain extends towards the bladder;
the thigh and leg of the affected side are benumbed;
the testicles are drawn upwards, and the urine is
obstructed.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>A stone in the bladder is known from a pain, at
the time, as well as before and after making water;
from the urine coming away by drops, or stopping
suddenly when it was running in a full stream; by a
violent pain in the neck of the bladder upon motion,
especially on horseback, or in a carriage on
a rough road; from a white, thick, copious, stinking,
mucous sediment in the urine; from an itching
in the top of the <i>penis</i>; from bloody urine;
from an inclination to go to stool during the discharge
of urine; from the patient’s passing his urine
more easily when lying than in an erect posture;
from a kind of convulsive motion occasioned by
the sharp pain in discharging the last drops of the
urine; and lastly, from sounding or searching with
the catheter.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Persons afflicted with the gravel
or stone should avoid aliments of a windy or
heating nature, as salt meats, sour fruits, &#38;c.
Their diet ought chiefly to consist of such things
as tend to promote the secretion of urine, and to
keep the body open. Artichokes, asparagus, spinnage,
lettuce, parsley, succory, purslane, turnips,
potatoes, carrots, and radishes, may be safely eaten.
Onions, leeks, and celery are, in this case, reckoned
medicinal. The most proper drinks are
whey, butter-milk, milk and water, barley-water;
decoctions or infusions of the roots of marsh-mallows,
parsley, liquorice, or of other mild mucilaginous
vegetables, as linseed, lime-tree buds or
leaves, &#38;c. If the patient has been accustomed
to generous liquors, he may drink small gin-punch.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gentle exercise is proper; but violent motion is
apt to occasion bloody urine. We would therefore
advise that it should be taken in moderation. Persons
afflicted with gravel often pass a great number
of stones after riding on horseback, or in a carriage;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_326'>326</span>but those who have a stone in the bladder
are seldom able to bear these kinds of exercise.
Where there is a hereditary tendency to this disease,
a sedentary life ought never to be indulged. Were
people careful, upon the first symptoms of gravel,
to observe a proper regimen of diet, and to take
sufficient exercise, it might often be carried off, or
at least prevented from increasing; but if the same
course which occasioned the disease is persisted in,
it must be aggravated.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——In what is called a fit of the
gravel, which is commonly occasioned by a stone
sticking in the <i>ureter</i> or some part of the urinary
passages, the patient must be bled, warm fomentations
should likewise be applied to the part affected,
emollient clysters administered, and diluting mucilaginous
liquors drank, &#38;c. The treatment of
this case has been fully pointed out under the
articles, <i>inflammation of the kidneys and bladder</i>,
to which we refer.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Whytt advises patients who are subject to
frequent fits of gravel in the kidneys, but have no
stone in the bladder, to drink every morning, two
or three hours before breakfast, an English pint of
oyster or cockle-shell lime-water. The Doctor
very justly observes, that though this quantity
might be too small to have any sensible effect in
dissolving a stone in the bladder, yet it may very
probably prevent its growth.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a stone is formed in the bladder, the Doctor
recommends Alicant soap, and oyster or cockle-shell
lime-water<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c010'><sup>[124]</sup></a>, to be taken in the following
manner: The patient must swallow every day, in
any form that is least disagreeable, an ounce of the
internal part of Alicant soap, and drink three or
four English pints of oyster or cockle shell lime-water.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>The soap is to be divided into three doses;
the largest to be taken fasting in the morning early;
the second at noon; and the third at seven in the
evening; drinking above each dose a large draught
of the lime-water; the remainder of which he may
take any time betwixt dinner and supper, instead
of other liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should begin with a smaller quantity
of the lime-water and soap than that mentioned
above; at first an English pint of the former, and
three drachms of the latter, may be taken daily.
This quantity, however, he may increase by degrees,
and ought to persevere in the use of these
medicines, especially if he finds any abatement of
his complaints, for several months; nay, if the
stone be very large, for years. It may likewise be
proper for the patient, if he be severely pained, not
only to begin with the soap and lime-water in small
quantities, but to take the second or third lime-water
instead of the first. However, after he has
been for some time accustomed to these medicines,
he may not only take the first water, but, if he
finds he can easily bear it, heighten its dissolving
power still more by pouring it a second time on
fresh calcined shells.</p>

<p class='c008'>The caustic alkali, or soap-lees, is the medicine
chiefly in vogue at present for the stone. It is of a
very acrid nature, and ought therefore to be given
in some gelatinous or mucilaginous liquor; as veal-broth,
new milk, linseed-tea, a solution of gum-arabic,
or a decoction of marsh-mallow roots. The
patient must begin with small doses of the lees, as
thirty or forty drops, and increase by degrees, as
far as the stomach can bear it<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c010'><sup>[125]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>Though the soap-lees and lime-water are the
most powerful medicines which have hitherto been
discovered for the stone; yet there are some things
of a more simple nature, which in certain cases are
found to be beneficial, and therefore deserve a trial.
An infusion of the seeds of <i>daucus sylvestris</i>, or wild
carrot, sweetened with honey, has been found to
give considerable ease in cases where the stomach
could not bear any thing of an acrid nature. A
decoction of raw coffee berries taken morning and
evening, to the quantity of eight or ten ounces,
with ten drops of sweet spirit of nitre, has likewise
been found very efficacious in bringing away large
quantities of earthy matter in flakes. Honey is
likewise found to be of considerable service, and
may be taken in gruel, or in any other form that is
more agreeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only other medicine which we shall mention
is the <i>uva ursi</i>. It has been greatly extolled of late
both for the gravel and stone. It seems however
to be in all respects inferior to the soap and lime-water;
but it is less disagreeable, and has frequently,
to my knowledge, relieved gravelly complaints.
It is generally taken in powder from half
a drachm to a whole drachm, two or three times
a day. It may however be taken to the quantity
of seven or eight drachms a day, with great safety
and good effect.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF INVOLUNTARY DISCHARGES OF BLOOD.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Spontaneous or involuntary discharges of
blood, often happen from various parts of the
body. These however are so far from being always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>dangerous, that they often prove salutary.
When such discharges are critical, which is frequently
the case in fevers, they ought not to be
stopped. Nor indeed is it proper at any time to
stop them, unless they be so great as to endanger
the patient’s life. Most people, afraid of the smallest
discharge of blood from any part of the body,
fly immediately to the use of styptic and astringent
medicines, by which means an inflammation of
the brain, or some other fatal disease, is occasioned,
which, had the discharge been allowed to go on,
might have been prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>Periodical discharges of blood, from whatever
part of the body they proceed, must not be stopped.
They are always the efforts of Nature to relieve
herself; and fatal diseases have often been the
consequence of obstructing them. It may indeed
be sometimes necessary to check the violence of
such discharges; but even this requires the greatest
caution. Instances might be given where the stopping
of a small periodical flux of blood, from one
of the fingers, has proved fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the early period of life, bleeding at the nose
is very common. Those who are farther advanced
in years are more liable to hæmoptoe, or discharge
of blood from the lungs. After the middle period
of life, hæmorrhoidal fluxes are most common;
and in the decline of life, discharges of blood from
the urinary passages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Involuntary fluxes of blood may proceed from
very different, and often from quite opposite causes.
Sometimes they are owing to a particular construction
of the body, as a sanguine temperament, a
laxity of the vessels, a plethoric habit, &#38;c. At
other times they proceed from a determination of
the blood towards one particular part, as the head,
the hæmorrhoidal veins, &#38;c. They may likewise
proceed from an inflammatory disposition of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>blood, in which case there is generally some degree
of fever: this likewise happens when the flux is occasioned
by an obstructed perspiration, or a stricture
upon the skin, the bowels, or any particular
part of the system.</p>

<p class='c008'>But a dissolved state of the blood will likewise
occasion hæmorrhages. Thus, in putrid fevers,
the dysentery, the scurvy, the malignant small-pox,
&#38;c. there are often very great discharges of blood
from different parts of the body. They may likewise
be brought on by too liberal an use of medicines
which tend to dissolve the blood, as cantharides,
the volatile alkaline salts, &#38;c. Food of an
acrid or irritating quality may likewise occasion
hæmorrhages; as also strong purges and vomits, or
any thing that greatly stimulates the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>Violent passions or agitations of the mind will
likewise have this effect. These often cause bleeding
at the nose, and I have known them sometimes
occasion an hæmorrhage in the brain. Violent efforts
of the body, by overstraining or hurting the
vessels, may have the same effect, especially when
the body is long kept in an unnatural posture, as
hanging the head very low, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cure of an hæmorrhage must be adapted to
its cause. When it proceeds from too much blood,
or a tendency to inflammation, bleeding, with gentle
purges, and other evacuations, will be necessary.
It will likewise be proper for the patient in this
case to live chiefly upon a vegetable diet, to avoid
all strong liquors, and food that is of an acrid, hot,
or stimulating quality. The body should be kept
cool, and the mind easy.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an hæmorrhage is owing to a putrid or
dissolved state of the blood, the patient ought to
live chiefly upon acid fruits with milk, and vegetables
of a nourishing nature, as sago, salop, &#38;c.
His drink may be wine diluted with water, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>sharpened with the juice of lemon, vinegar, or
spirits of vitriol. The best medicine in this case
is the Peruvian bark, which may be taken according
to the urgency of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a flux of blood is the effect of acrid food,
or of strong stimulating medicines, the cure is to
be effected by soft and mucilaginous diet. The
patient may likewise take frequently about the bulk
of a nutmeg of Locatelli’s balsam, or the same
quantity of sperma-ceti.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an obstructed perspiration, or a stricture
upon any part of the system, is the cause of an
hæmorrhage, it may be removed by drinking warm
diluting liquors, lying a-bed, bathing the extremities
in warm water, &#38;c.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF BLEEDING AT THE NOSE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Bleeding at the nose is commonly preceded by
some degree of quickness of the pulse, flushing in
the face, pulsation of the temporal arteries, heaviness
in the head, dimness of the sight, heat and
itching of the nostrils, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>To persons who abound with blood this discharge
is very salutary. It often cures a vertigo, the head-ach,
a phrenzy, and even an epilepsy. In fevers,
where there is a great determination of blood towards
the head, it is of the utmost service. It is
likewise beneficial in inflammations of the liver and
spleen, and often in the gout and rheumatism. In
all diseases where bleeding is necessary, a spontaneous
discharge of blood from the nose is of much
more service than the same quantity let with a
lancet.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a discharge of blood from the nose, the great
point is to determine whether it ought to be stopped
or not. It is a common practice to stop the bleeding,
without considering whether it be a disease, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>the cure of a disease. This conduct proceeds from
fear; but it has often bad, and sometimes fatal
consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a discharge of blood from the nose happens
in an inflammatory disease, there is always
reason to believe that it may prove salutary; and
therefore it should be suffered to go on, at least as
long as the patient is not weakened by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it happens to persons in perfect health,
who are full of blood, it ought not to be suddenly
stopped, especially if the symptoms of plethora,
mentioned above, have preceded it. In this case
it cannot be stopped without risking the patient’s
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fine, whenever bleeding at the nose relieves
any bad symptom, and does not proceed so far as
to endanger the patient’s life, it ought not to be
stopped. But when it returns frequently, or continues
till the pulse becomes low, the extremities
begin to grow cold, the lips pale, or the patient
complains of being sick or faint, it must immediately
be stopped.</p>

<p class='c008'>For this purpose the patient should be set nearly
upright, with his head reclining a little, and his
legs immersed in water about the warmth of new
milk. His hands ought likewise to be put in lukewarm
water, and his garters may be tied a little
tighter than usual. Ligatures may be applied to
the arms, about the place where they are usually
made for bleeding, and with nearly the same degree
of tightness. These must be gradually slackened
as the blood begins to stop, and removed entirely
as soon as it gives over.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes dry lint put up the nostrils will stop
the bleeding. When this does not succeed, dossils
of lint dipped in strong spirits of wine, may be
put up the nostrils, or if that cannot be had, they
may be dipped in brandy. Blue vitriol dissolved
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>in water may likewise be used for this purpose, or
a tent dipped in the white of an egg beat up,
may be rolled in a powder made of equal parts of
white sugar, burnt allum, and white vitriol, and
put up the nostril from whence the blood issues.</p>

<p class='c008'>Internal medicines can hardly be of use here, as
they have seldom time to operate. It may not
however be amiss to give the patient half an ounce
of Glauber’s salt, and the same quantity of manna,
dissolved in four or five ounces of barley-water.
This may be taken at a draught, and repeated, if it
does not operate, in a few hours. Ten or twelve
grains of nitre may be taken in a glass of cold water
and vinegar every hour, or oftner, if the stomach
will bear it. If a stronger medicine be necessary,
a tea-cupful of the tincture of roses, with
twenty or thirty drops of the weak spirit of vitriol,
may be taken every hour. When these things
cannot be had, the patient may drink water, with
a little common salt in it, or equal parts of water
and vinegar.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the genitals be immersed for some time in
cold water, it will generally stop a bleeding at the
nose. I have not known this fail.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes, when the bleeding is stopped outwardly,
it continues inwardly. This is very troublesome,
and requires particular attention, as the patient
is apt to be suffocated with the blood, especially
if he falls asleep, which he is very ready to
do after losing a great quantity of blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient is in danger of suffocation
from the blood getting into his throat, the passages
may be stopped by drawing threads up the nostrils,
and bringing them out at the mouth, then fastening
pieces of spunge, or small rolls of linen cloth
to their extremities; afterwards drawing them back,
and tying them on the outside with a sufficient degree
of tightness.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>After the bleeding is stopped, the patient ought
to be kept as easy and quiet as possible. He should
not pick his nose, nor take away the tents or clotted
blood, till they fall off of their own accord, and
should not lie with his head low.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are affected with frequent bleeding at
the nose ought to bathe their feet often in warm
water, and to keep them warm and dry. They
ought to wear nothing tight about their necks, to
keep their body as much in an erect posture as possible,
and never to view any object obliquely. If
they have too much blood, a vegetable diet, with
now and then a cooling purge, is the safest way to
lessen it.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the disease proceeds from a thin dissolved
flare of the blood, the diet should be rich
and nourishing; as strong broths and jellies, sago-gruel
with wine and sugar, &#38;c. Infusions of the
Peruvian bark in wine ought likewise to be taken
and persisted in for a considerable time.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE BLEEDING AND BLIND PILES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A discharge of blood from the hæmorrhoidal
vessels is called the <i>bleeding piles</i>. When the vessels
only swell, and discharge no blood, but are exceeding
painful, the disease is called the <i>blind piles</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons of a loose spungy fibre, of a bulky size,
who live high, and lead a sedentary inactive life, are
most subject to this disease. It is often owing to a
hereditary disposition. Where this is the case, it
attacks persons more early in life than when it is
accidental. Men are more liable to it than women,
especially those of a sanguine, plethoric, or a
scorbutic habit, or of a melancholy disposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The piles may be occasioned by an excess of
blood, by strong aloetic purges, high-seasoned food,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>drinking great quantities of sweet wines, the neglect
of bleeding, or other customary evacuations,
much riding, great costiveness, or any thing that
occasions hard or difficult stools. Anger, grief, or
other violent passions, will likewise occasion the
piles. I have often known them brought on by
sitting on the damp ground. A pair of thin breeches
will excite the disorder in a person who is subject to
it, and sometimes even in those who never had it
before. Pregnant women are often afflicted with
the piles.</p>

<p class='c008'>A flux of blood from the <i>anus</i> is not always to
be treated as a disease. It is even more salutary
than bleeding at the nose, and often prevents or
carries off diseases. It is peculiarly beneficial in
the gout, rheumatism, asthma, and hypochondriacal
complaints, and often proves critical in colics, and
inflammatory fevers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the management of the patient, regard must
be had to his habit of body, his age, strength, and
manner of living. A discharge which might be
excessive and prove hurtful to one, may be very
moderate, and even salutary to another. That only
is to be esteemed dangerous which continues too
long, and is in such quantity as to waste the patient’s
strength, hurt the digestion, nutrition, and
other functions necessary to life.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this is the case, the discharge must be
checked by a proper regimen, and astringent medicines.
The DIET must be cool but nourishing,
consisting chiefly of bread, milk, cooling vegetables
and broths. The drink may be chalybeate
water, orange-whey, decoctions or infusions of the
astringent and mucilaginous plants, as the tormentil
root, bistort, the marsh-mallow-roots, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Old conserve of red roses is a very good medicine
in this case. It may be mixed with new milk,
and taken in the quantity of an ounce three or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>four times a-day. This medicine is in no great
repute, owing to its being seldom taken in such
quantity as to produce any effects; but when taken
as here directed, and duly persisted in, I have
known it perform very extraordinary cures in violent
hæmorrhages, especially when assisted by the
tincture of roses; a tea-cupful of which may be
taken about an hour after every dose of the conserve.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Peruvian bark is likewise proper in this
case, both as a strengthener and astringent. Half
a drachm of it may be taken in a glass of red-wine,
sharpened with a few drops of the elixir of vitriol,
three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The bleeding piles are sometimes periodical,
and return regularly once a month, or once in three
weeks. In this case they are always to be considered
as a salutary discharge, and by no means to
be stopped. Some have entirely ruined their health
by stopping a periodical discharge of blood from
the hæmorrhoidal veins.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>blind piles</i> bleeding is generally of use.
The diet must be light and thin, and the drink
cool and diluting. It is likewise necessary that
the body be kept gently open. This may be done
by small doses of the flowers of brimstone and cream
of tartar. These may be mixed in equal quantities,
and a tea-spoonful taken two or three times a-day,
or oftner if necessary. Or an ounce of the flowers
of brimstone and half an ounce of purified nitre
may be mixed with three or four ounces of the lenitive
electuary, and a tea-spoonful of it taken
three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emollient clysters are here likewise beneficial;
but there is sometimes such an astriction of the
<i>anus</i>, that they cannot be thrown up. In this case
I have known a vomit have a very good effect.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>When the piles are exceeding painful and swelled,
but discharge nothing, the patient must sit over the
steams of warm water. He may likewise apply a
linen cloth dipped in warm spirits of wine to the
part, or poultices made of bread and milk, or of
leeks fried with butter. If these do not produce a
discharge, and the piles appear large, leeches must
be applied as near them as possible, or, if they will
fix upon the piles themselves, so much the better.
When leeches will not fix, the piles may be opened
with a lancet. The operation is very easy, and is
attended with no danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Various ointments, and other external applications,
are recommended in the piles; but I do not
remember to have seen any effects from these worth
mentioning. Their principal use is to keep the
part moist, which may be done as well by a soft
poultice, or an emollient cataplasm. When the
pain however is very great, a liniment made of
two ounces of emollient ointment, and half an
ounce of liquid laudanum, beat up with the yolk
of an egg, may be applied.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SPITTING OF BLOOD.</h4>

<p class='c018'>We mean here to treat of that discharge of blood
from the lungs only which is called an <i>hæmoptoe</i>, or
<i>spitting of blood</i>. Persons of a slender make, and a
lax fibre, who have long necks and strait breasts,
are most liable to this disease. It is most common
in the spring, and generally attacks people before
they arrive at the prime or middle period of life.
It is a common observation, that those who have
been subject to bleeding at the nose when young,
are afterwards most liable to an hæmoptoe.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——An hæmoptoe may proceed from
excess of blood, from a peculiar weakness of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>lungs, or a bad conformation of the breast. It is
often occasioned by excessive drinking, running,
wrestling, singing, or speaking aloud. Such as
have weak lungs ought to avoid all violent exertions
of that organ, as they value life. They
should likewise guard against violent passions, excessive
drinking, and every thing that occasions a
rapid circulation of the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease may likewise proceed from wounds
of the lungs. These may either be received from
without, or they may be occasioned by hard bodies
getting into the wind-pipe, and so falling down
upon the lungs, and hurting that tender organ.
The obstruction of any customary evacuation may
occasion a spitting of blood; as neglect of bleeding
or purging at the usual seasons, the stoppage of the
bleeding piles in men, or the menses in women, &#38;c.
It may likewise proceed from a polypus, scirrhous
concretions, or any thing that obstructs the circulation
of the blood in the lungs. It is often the effect
of a long and violent cough; in which case it
is generally the forerunner of a consumption. A
violent degree of cold suddenly applied to the external
parts of the body will occasion an hæmoptoe.
It may likewise be occasioned by breathing air
which is too much rarified to be able properly to expand
the lungs. This is often the case with those
who work in hot places, as furnaces, glasshouses,
or the like. It is likewise said to happen to such
as ascend to the top of very high mountains, as the
Peak of Teneriff, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spitting of blood is not always to be considered
as a primary disease. It is often only a symptom,
and in some diseases not an unfavourable one. This
is the case in pleurisies, peripneumonies, and sundry
other fevers. In a dropsy, scurvy, or consumption,
it is a bad symptom, and shews that the lungs
are ulcerated.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>SYMPTOMS.——Spitting of blood is generally
preceded by a sense of weight, and oppression of
the breast, a dry tickling cough, hoarseness, and a
difficulty of breathing. Sometimes it is ushered in
with shivering coldness of the extremities, costiveness,
great lassitude, flatulence, pain of the back
and loins, &#38;c. As these shew a general stricture
upon the vessels, and a tendency of the blood to
inflammation, they are commonly the forerunners
of a very copious discharge. The above symptoms
do not attend a discharge of blood from the gums
or fauces, by which means these may always be
distinguished from an hæmoptoe. Sometimes the
blood that is spit up is thin, and of a florid red colour;
and at other times it is thick, and of a dark
or blackish colour; nothing however can be inferred
from this circumstance, but that the blood has
lain a longer or shorter time in the breast before it
was discharged.</p>

<p class='c008'>Spitting of blood, in a strong healthy person,
of a sound constitution, is not very dangerous; but
when it attacks the tender and delicate, or persons
of a weak lax fibre, it is with difficulty removed.
When it proceeds from a scirrhus or polypus of
the lungs, it is bad. The danger is greater when
the discharge proceeds from the rupture of a large
vessel than of a small one. When the extravasated
blood is not spit up, but lodges in the breast, it
corrupts, and greatly increases the danger. When
the blood proceeds from an ulcer in the lungs, it
is generally fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The patient ought to be kept
cool and easy. Every thing that heats the body or
quickens the circulation, increases the danger.
The mind ought likewise to be soothed, and every
occasion of exciting the passions avoided. The
diet should be soft, cooling, and slender; as rice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>boiled with milk, small broths, barley-gruels, panado,
&#38;c. The diet, in this case, can scarce be
too low. Even water-gruel is sufficient to support
the patient for some days. All strong liquors must
be avoided. The patient may drink milk and water,
barley-water, whey, butter-milk, and such
like. Every thing however should be drank cold,
and in small quantities at a time. He should observe
the strictest silence, or at least speak with a
very low voice.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——This, like the other involuntary
discharges of blood, ought not to be suddenly stopped
by astringent medicines. More mischief is often
done by these than if it were suffered to go on. It
may however proceed so far as to weaken the patient,
and even endanger his life; in which case proper
means must be used for restraining it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The body should be kept gently open by laxative
diet; as roasted apples, stewed prunes, and
such like. If these should not have the desired
effect, a tea-spoonful of the lenitive electuary may
be taken twice or thrice a-day, as is found necessary.
If the bleeding proves violent, ligatures may be applied
to the extremities, as directed for a bleeding
at the nose.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be hot or feverish, bleeding and
small doses of nitre will be of use; a scruple or
half a drachm of nitre may be taken in a cup of
his ordinary drink twice or thrice a-day. His drink
may likewise be sharpened with acids, as juice of
lemon, or a few drops of the spirit of vitriol;
or he may take frequently a cup of the tincture of
roses.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bathing the feet and legs in lukewarm water has
likewise a very good effect in this disease. Opiates
too are sometimes beneficial; but these must
be administered with caution. Ten or twelve drops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>of laudanum may be given in a cup of barley-water
twice a-day, and continued for some time, provided
they be found beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conserve of roses is likewise a very good
medicine in this case, provided it be taken in sufficient
quantity, and long enough persisted in. It
may be taken to the quantity of three or four
ounces a-day; and, if the patient be troubled with
a cough, it should be made into an electuary with
balsamic syrup, and a little of the syrup of poppies.</p>

<p class='c008'>If stronger astringents be necessary, fifteen or
twenty drops of the elixir of vitriol may be given
in a glass of water three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are subject to frequent returns of this
disease should avoid all excess. Their diet should
be light and cool, consisting chiefly of milk and
vegetables. Above all, let them beware of vigorous
efforts of the body, and violent agitations
of the mind.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>VOMITING OF BLOOD.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This is not so common as the other discharges
of blood which have already been mentioned; but
it is very dangerous, and requires particular attention.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vomiting of blood is generally preceded by pain
of the stomach, sickness, and nausea; and is accompanied
with great anxiety, and frequent fainting
fits.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease is sometimes periodical; in which
case it is less dangerous. It often proceeds from
an obstruction of the menses in women; and sometimes
from the stopping of the hæmorrhoidal flux
in men. It may be occasioned by any thing that
greatly stimulates or wounds the stomach, as strong
vomits or purges, acrid poisons, sharp or hard substances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>taken into the stomach, &#38;c. It is often
the effect of obstructions in the liver, the spleen,
or some of the other viscera. It may likewise proceed
from external violence, as blows or bruises,
or from any of the causes which produce inflammation.
In hysteric women, vomiting of blood is a
very common, but by no means a dangerous symptom.</p>

<p class='c008'>A great part of the danger in this disease arises
from the extravasated blood lodging in the bowels,
and becoming putrid, by which means a dysentery
or putrid fever may be occasioned. The best way
of preventing this, is to keep the body gently
open, by frequently exhibiting emollient clysters.
Purges must not be given till the discharge is stopt,
otherwise they will irritate the stomach, and increase
the disorder. All the food and drink must
be of a mild cooling nature, and taken in small
quantities. Even drinking cold water has sometimes
proved a remedy, but it will succeed better
when sharpened with the weak spirits of vitriol.
When there are signs of an inflammation, bleeding
may be necessary; but the patient’s weakness will
seldom permit it. Opiates may be of use; but
they must be given in very small doses, as four
or five drops of liquid laudanum twice or thrice
a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the discharge is over, as the patient is generally
troubled with gripes, occasioned by the
acrimony of the blood lodged in the intestines,
gentle purges will be necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF BLOODY URINE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This is a discharge of blood from the vessels of
the kidneys or bladder, occasioned by their being
either enlarged, broken, or eroded. It is more or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>less dangerous according to the different circumstances
which attend it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When pure blood is voided suddenly without interruption
and without pain, it proceeds from the
kidneys; but if the blood be in small quantity, of
a dark colour, and emitted with heat and pain about
the bottom of the belly, it proceeds from the bladder.
When bloody urine is occasioned by a rough
stone descending from the kidneys to the bladder,
which wounds the <i>ureters</i>, it is attended with a
sharp pain in the back, and difficulty of making
water. If the coats of the bladder are hurt by a
stone, and the bloody urine follows, it is attended
with the most acute pain, and a previous stoppage
of urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bloody urine may likewise be occasioned by falls,
blows, the lifting or carrying of heavy burdens,
hard riding, or any violent motion. It may also
proceed from ulcers of the bladder, from a stone
lodged in the kidneys, or from violent purges, or
sharp diuretic medicines, especially cantharides.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bloody urine is always attended with some degree
of danger: but it is peculiarly so when mixed
with purulent matter, as this shews an ulcer somewhere
in the urinary passages. Sometimes this discharge
proceeds from excess of blood, in which
case it is rather to be considered as a salutary evacuation
than a disease. If the discharge however
be very great, it may waste the patient’s strength,
and occasion an ill habit of body, a dropsy, or
a consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>The treatment of this disorder must be varied according
to the different causes from which it proceeds.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it is owing to a stone in the bladder, the
cure depends upon an operation; a description of
which would be foreign to our purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>If it be attended with a plethora, and symptoms
of inflammation, bleeding will be necessary. The
body must likewise be kept open by emollient clysters,
or cooling purgative medicines; as cream of
tartar, rhubarb, manna, or small doses of lenitive
electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When bloody urine proceeds from a dissolved
state of the blood, it is commonly the symptom of
some malignant disease; as the small-pox, a putrid
fever, or the like. In this case the patient’s life
depends on the liberal use of the Peruvian bark
and acids, as has already been shewn.</p>

<p class='c008'>When there is reason to suspect an ulcer in the
kidneys or bladder, the patient’s diet must be cool,
and his drink of a soft, healing, balsamic quality,
as decoctions of marsh-mallow roots with liquorice,
solutions of gum-arabic, &#38;c. Three ounces of
marsh-mallow roots, and half an ounce of liquorice,
may be boiled in two English quarts of water to
one; two ounces of gum-arabic, and half an ounce
of purified nitre, may be dissolved in the strained
liquor, and a tea-cupful of it taken four or five
times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The early use of astringents in this disease has
often bad consequences. When the flux is stopped
too soon, the grumous blood, by being confined
in the vessels, may produce inflammations,
abscess, and ulcers. If however the case be urgent,
or the patient seems to suffer from the loss of blood,
gentle astringents may be necessary. In this case
the patient may take three or four ounces of lime-water,
with half an ounce of the tincture of Peruvian
bark, three times a-day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF THE DYSENTERY, OR BLOODY FLUX.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This disease prevails in the spring and autumn.
It is most common in marshy countries, where, after
hot and dry summers, it is apt to become epidemic.
Persons are most liable to it who are much exposed
to the night-air, or who live in places where the
air is confined and unwholesome. Hence it often
proves fatal in camps, on shipboard, in jails, hospitals,
and such like places.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The dysentery may be occasioned
by any thing that obstructs the perforation, or renders
the humours putrid; as damp beds, wet clothes,
unwholesome diet, air, &#38;c. But it is most frequently
communicated by infection. This ought
to make people extremely cautious in going near
such persons as labour under the disease. Even the
smell of the patient’s excrements has been known to
communicate the infection.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——It is known by a flux of the
belly, attended with violent pain of the bowels, a
constant inclination to go to stool, and generally
more or less blood in the stools. It begins, like
other fevers, with chillness, loss of strength, a
quick pulse, great thirst, and an inclination to vomit.
The stools are at first greasy and frothy, afterwards
they are streaked with blood, and at last
have frequently the appearance of pure blood, mixed
with small filaments resembling bits of skin. Worms
are sometimes passed both upwards and downwards
through the whole course of the disease. When
the patient goes to stool, he feels a bearing down,
as if the whole bowels were falling out, and sometimes
a part of the intestine is actually protruded,
which proves exceeding troublesome, especially in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>children. Flatulency is likewise a troublesome
symptom, especially towards the end of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease may be distinguished from a diarrhœa
or looseness, by the acute pain of the bowels,
and the blood which generally appears in the stools.
It may be distinguished from the <i>cholera morbus</i> by
its not being attended with such violent and frequent
fits of vomiting, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the dysentery attacks the old, the delicate,
or such as have been wasted by the gout, the scurvy,
or other lingering diseases, it generally proves
fatal. Vomiting and hiccuping are bad signs, as
they shew an inflammation of the stomach. When
the stools are green, black, or have an exceeding
disagreeable cadaverous smell, the danger is very
great, as it shows the disease to be of the putrid
kind. It is an unfavourable symptom when clysters
are immediately returned; but still more so, when
the passage is so obstinately shut, that they cannot
be injected. A feeble pulse, coldness of the extremities,
with difficulty of swallowing, and convulsions,
are signs of approaching death.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Nothing is of more importance
in this disease than cleanliness. It contributes
greatly to the recovery of the patient, and no less
to the safety of such as attend him. In all contagious
diseases the danger is increased, and the infection
spread, by the neglect of cleanliness, but
in no one more than this. Every thing about the
patient should be frequently changed. The excrements
should never be suffered to continue in his
chamber, but removed immediately, and buried
under ground. A constant stream of fresh air
should be admitted into the chamber; and it ought
frequently to be sprinkled with vinegar, juice of lemon,
or some other strong acid.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>The patient must not be discouraged, but his spirits
kept up in hopes of a cure. Nothing tends
more to render any putrid disease mortal, than the
fears and apprehensions of the sick. All diseases
of this nature have a tendency to sink and depress
the spirits, and when that is increased by fears and
alarms from those whom the patient believes to
be persons of skill, it cannot fail to have the worst
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>A flannel waistcoat worn next the skin has often
a very good effect in the dysentery. This promotes
the perspiration without overheating the body.
Great caution however is necessary in leaving it off.
I have often known a dysentery brought on by imprudently
throwing off a flannel waistcoat before
the season was sufficiently warm. For whatever
purpose this piece of dress is worn, it should never
be left off but in a warm season.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this disease the greatest attention must be paid
to the patient’s diet. Flesh, fish, and every thing
that has a tendency to turn putrid or rancid on the
stomach, must be abstained from. Apples boiled
in milk, water-pap, and plain light pudding, with
broth made of the gelatinous parts of animals, may
constitute the principal part of the patient’s food.
Gelatinous broth not only answers the purpose of
food, but likewise of medicine. I have often known
dysenteries, which were not of a putrid nature,
cured by it after pompous medicines had proved
ineffectual<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c010'><sup>[126]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>Another kind of food very proper in the dysentery,
which may be used by such as cannot take the
broth mentioned above, is made by boiling a few
handfuls of fine flour, tied in a cloth, for six or seven
hours, till it becomes as hard as starch. Two
or three table-spoonfuls of this may be grated
down, and boiled in such a quantity of new milk
and water as to be of the thickness of pap. This
may be sweetened to the patient’s taste, and taken
for his ordinary food<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c010'><sup>[127]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a <i>putrid dysentery</i> the patient may be allowed
to eat freely of most kinds of good ripe fruit; as
apples, grapes, gooseberries, currant-berries, strawberries,
&#38;c. These may either be eaten raw or
boiled, with or without milk, as the patient chuses.
The prejudice against fruit in this disease is so great,
that many believe it to be the common cause of
dysenteries. This however is an egregious mistake.
Both reason and experience shew, that good fruit
is one of the best medicines, both for the prevention
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>and cure of the dysentery. Good fruit is in
every respect calculated to counteract that tendency
to putrefaction, from whence the most dangerous
kind of dysentery proceeds. The patient in such a
case ought therefore be allowed to eat as much
fruit as he pleases, provided it be ripe<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c010'><sup>[128]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper drink in this disorder is whey.
The dysentery has often been cured by the use of
clear whey alone. It may be taken both for drink
and in form of clyster. When whey cannot be
had, barley-water sharpened with cream of tartar
may be drank, or a decoction of barley and tamarinds;
two ounces of the former and one of the
latter may be boiled in two English quarts of water
to one. Warm water, water-gruel, or water
wherein hot iron has been frequently quenched, are
all very proper, and may be drank in turns. Camomile-tea,
if the stomach will bear it, is an exceeding
proper drink. It both strengthens the stomach,
and by its antiseptic quality tends to prevent
a mortification of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——At the beginning of this disease
it is always necessary to cleanse the first passages.
For this purpose a vomit of ipecacuanha
must be given, and wrought off with weak camomile-tea.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>Strong vomits are seldom necessary here.
A scruple, or at most half a drachm of ipecacuanha,
is generally sufficient for an adult, and sometimes
a very few grains will suffice. The day after the
vomit, half a drachm, or two scruples of rhubarb,
must be taken; or, what will answer the purpose
rather better, an ounce or an ounce and a half of
Epsom salts. This dose may be repeated every
other day for two or three times. Afterwards
small doles of ipecacuanha may be taken for some
time. Two or three grains of the powder may be
mixed in a table-spoonful of the syrup of poppies,
and taken three times a day.</p>

<p class='c008'>These evacuations, and the regimen prescribed
above, will often be sufficient to effect a cure.
Should it however happen otherwise, the following
astringent medicines may be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>A clyster of starch or fat mutton-broth, with
thirty or forty drops of liquid laudanum in it, may
be administered twice a-day. At the same time an
ounce of gum-arabic, and half an ounce of gum-tragacanth,
may be dissolved in an English pint of
barley-water, over a slow fire, and a table-spoonful
of it taken every hour.</p>

<p class='c008'>If these have not the desired effect, the patient
may take, four times a-day, about the bulk of a
nutmeg of the <i>Japonic confection</i>, drinking after it a
tea-cupful of the decoction of logwood<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c010'><sup>[129]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who have been cured of this disease are
very liable to suffer a relapse; to prevent which,
great circumspection with respect to diet is necessary.
The patient must abstain from all fermented
liquors, except now and then a glass of good wine;
but he must drink no kind of malt-liquor. He
should likewise abstain from animal food, as fish and
flesh, and live principally on milk and vegetables.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_351'>351</span>Gentle exercise and wholesome air are likewise of
importance. The patient should go to the country
as soon as his strength will permit, and should take
exercise daily on horseback, or in a carriage. He
may likewise use bitters infused in wine or brandy,
and may drink twice a-day a gill of lime-water
mixed with an equal quantity of new milk.</p>

<p class='c008'>When dysenteries prevail, we would recommend
a strict attention to cleanliness, a spare use of animal
food, and the free use of sound ripe fruits, and
other vegetables. The night air is to be carefully
avoided, and all communication with the sick.
Bad smells are likewise to be shunned, especially
those which arise from putrid animal substances.
The necessaries where the sick go are carefully to
be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the first symptoms of the dysentery appear,
the patient ought immediately to take a vomit,
to go to bed, and drink plentifully of weak
warm liquor, to promote a sweat. This, with a
dose or two of rhubarb at the beginning, would
often carry off the disease. In countries where
dysenteries prevail, we would advise such as are
liable to them, to take either a vomit or a purge
every spring or autumn, as a preventive.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are sundry other fluxes of the belly, as the
LIENTERY and CŒLIAC PASSION, which,
though less dangerous than the dysentery, yet merit
consideration. These diseases generally proceed
from a relaxed state of the stomach and intestines,
which is sometimes so great, that the food passes
through them without almost any sensible alterations;
and the patient dies merely from the want of nourishment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the lientery or cœliac passion succeeds to
a dysentery, the case is bad. They are always dangerous
in old age, especially when the constitution
has been broken by excess or acute diseases. If the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_352'>352</span>stools be very frequent, and quite crude, the thirst
great, with little urine, the mouth ulcerated, and
the face marked with spots of different colours,
the danger is very great.</p>

<p class='c008'>The treatment of the patient is in general the
same as in the dysentery. In all obstinate fluxes of
the belly, the cure must be attempted, by first
cleansing the stomach and bowels with gentle vomits
and purges; afterwards such a diet as has a
tendency to heal and strengthen the bowels, with
opiates and astringent medicines, will generally
perfect the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same observation holds with respect to a
TENESMUS, or frequent desire of going to stool.
This disease resembles the dysentery so much, both
in its symptoms and method of cure, that we think
it needless to insist upon it.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXIV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE HEAD-ACH.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Aches and pains proceed from very different
causes, and may affect any part of the body;
but we shall point out those only which occur most
frequently, and are attended with the greatest danger.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the head-ach is slight, and affects a particular
part of the head only, it is called <i>cephalalgia</i>;
when the whole head is affected, <i>cephalæa</i>; and when
on one side only, <i>hemicrania</i>. A fixed pain in the
forehead, which may be covered with the end of
the thumb, is called the <i>clavis hystericus</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are also other distinctions. Sometimes the
pain is internal, sometimes external; sometimes it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_353'>353</span>is an original disease, and at other times only symptomatic.
When the head-ach proceeds from a hot
bilious habit, the pain is very acute and throbbing,
with a considerable heat of the part affected. When
from a cold phlegmatic habit, the patient complains
of a dull heavy pain, and has a sense of coldness
in the part. This kind of head-ach is sometimes
attended with a degree of stupidity or folly.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever obstructs the free circulation of the
blood through the vessels of the head, may occasion
a head-ach. In persons of a full habit, who abound
with blood, or other humours, the head-ach often
proceeds from the suppression of customary evacuations;
as bleeding at the nose, sweating of the feet,
&#38;c. It may likewise proceed from any cause that
determines a great flux of blood towards the head;
as coldness of the extremities, or hanging down
the head for a long time. Whatever prevents the
return of the blood from the head will likewise occasion
a head-ach; as looking long obliquely at
any object, wearing any thing tight about the neck,
or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a head-ach proceeds from the stoppage of
a running at the nose, there is a heavy, obtuse,
pressing pain in the fore-part of the head, in which
there seems to be such a weight, that the patient
can scarce hold it up. When it is occasioned by
the caustic matter of the venereal disease, it generally
affects the skull, and often produces a <i>caries</i>
of the bones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the head-ach proceeds from the repulsion
or retrocession of the gout, the erysipelas,
the small-pox, measles, itch, or other eruptive diseases.
What is called a <i>hemicrania</i> generally proceeds
from crudities or indigestion. Inanition, or
emptiness, will often also occasion head-achs. I have
often seen instances of this in nurses who gave suck
<span class='pageno' id='Page_354'>354</span>too long, or who did not take a sufficient quantity
of solid food.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is likewise a most violent, fixed, constant,
and almost intolerable head-ach, which occasions
great debility both of body and mind, prevents
sleep, destroys the appetite, causes a <i>vertigo</i>,
dimness of sight, a noise in the ears, convulsions,
epileptic fits, and sometimes vomiting, costiveness,
coldness of the extremities, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The head-ach is often symptomatic in continual
and intermitting fevers, especially quartans. It is
likewise a very common symptom in hysteric and
hypochondriac complaints.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a head-ach attends an acute fever, with
pale urine, it is an unfavourable symptom. In excessive
head-achs, coldness of the extremities is a
bad sign.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease continues long, and is very violent,
it often terminates in blindness, an apoplexy,
deafness, a <i>vertigo</i>, the palsy, epilepsy, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this disease the cool regimen in general is to
be observed. The diet ought to consist of such
emollient substances as will correct the acrimony
of the humours, and keep the body open; as apples
boiled in milk, spinage, turnips, and such like.
The drink ought to be diluting; as barley-water,
infusions of mild mucilaginous vegetables, decoctions
of the sudorific woods, &#38;c. The feet and
legs ought to be kept warm, and frequently bathed
in lukewarm water; the head should be shaved,
and bathed with water and vinegar. The patient
ought as much as possible to keep in an erect posture,
and not to lie with his head too low.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the head-ach is owing to excess of blood,
or an hot bilious constitution, bleeding is necessary.
The patient may be bled in the jugular vein,
and the operation repeated if there be occasion.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_355'>355</span>Cupping also, or the application of leeches to the
temples, and behind the ears, will be of service.
Afterwards a blistering-plaster may be applied to
the neck behind the ears, or to any part of the head
that is most affected. In some cases it will be proper
to blister the whole head. In persons of a
gross habit, issues or perpetual blisters will be of
service. The body ought likewise to be kept open
by gentle laxatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>But when the head-ach proceeds from a copious
vitiated <i>serum</i> stagnating in the membranes, either
within or without the skull, with a dull, heavy, continual
pain, which will neither yield to bleeding
nor gentle laxatives, then more powerful purgatives
are necessary, as pills made of aloes, resin of jalap,
or the like. It will also be necessary in this case to
blister the whole head, and to keep the back part
of the neck open for a considerable time by a perpetual
blister.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the head-ach is occasioned by the stoppage
of a running at the nose, the patient should
frequently smell to a bottle of volatile salts; he
may likewise take snuff, or any thing that will irritate
the nose, so as to promote a discharge from it;
as the herb mastich, ground-ivy, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>hemicrania</i>, especially a periodical one, is generally
owing to a foulness of the stomach, for which
gentle vomits must be administered, as also purges
of rhubarb. After the bowels have been sufficiently
cleared, chalybeate waters, and such bitters as
strengthen the stomach, will be necessary. A periodical
head-ach has been cured by wearing a piece
of flannel over the forehead during the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the head-ach arises from a vitiated state
of the humours, as in the scurvy and venereal
disease, the patient, after proper evacuations, must
drink freely of the decoction of woods, or the
decoction of sarsaparilla, with raisins and liquorice<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c010'><sup>[130]</sup></a>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_356'>356</span>These promote perspiration, sweeten the
humours, and, if duly persisted in, will produce
very happy effects. When a collection of matter
is felt under the skin, it must be discharged by
an incision, otherwise it will render the bone carious.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the head-ach is so intolerable as to endanger
the patient’s life, or is attended with continual
watching, delirium, &#38;c. recourse must be had to
opiates. These, after proper evacuations by clysters
or mild purgatives, may be applied both externally
and internally. The affected part may be
rubbed with Bate’s anodyne balsam, or a cloth dipped
in it may be applied to the part. The patient
may, at the same time, take twenty drops of laudanum,
in a cup of valerian or penny-royal tea,
twice or thrice a day. This is only to be done in
case of extreme pain. Proper evacuations ought
always to accompany and follow the use of opiates<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c010'><sup>[131]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient cannot bear the loss of blood,
his feet ought frequently to be bathed in lukewarm
water, and well rubbed with a coarse cloth. Cataplasms
with mustard or horse-radish ought likewise to
be applied to them. This course is peculiarly necessary
when the pain proceeds from a gouty humour
affecting the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the head-ach is occasioned by great heat,
hard labour, or violent exercise of any kind, it may
be allayed by cooling medicines; as the saline
draughts with nitre, and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>A little of Ward’s essence, dropt into the palm
of the hand, and applied to the forehead, will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_357'>357</span>sometimes remove a violent head-ach; and so will
æther, when applied in the same manner.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE TOOTH-ACH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This disease is so well known, that it needs no
description. It has great affinity with the rheumatism,
and often succeeds pains of the shoulders and
other parts of the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may proceed from obstructed perspiration, or
any of the other causes of inflammation. I have
often known the tooth-ach occasioned by neglecting
some part of the usual coverings of the head, by
sitting with the head <a id='t357'></a>bare near an open window, or
exposing it any how to a draught of cold air. Food
or drink taken either too hot or too cold is very
hurtful to the teeth. Great quantities of sugar, or
other sweetmeats, are likewise hurtful. Nothing
is more destructive to the teeth than cracking nuts,
or chewing any kind of hard substances. Picking
the teeth with pins, needles, or any thing that may
hurt the enamel with which they are covered, does
great mischief, as the tooth is sure to be spoiled
whenever the air gets into it. Breeding women
are very subject to the tooth-ach, especially during
the first three or four months of pregnancy. The
tooth-ach often proceeds from scorbutic humours
affecting the gums. In this case the teeth are sometimes
wasted, and fall out without any considerable
degree of pain. The more immediate cause of the
tooth-ach is a rotten or <i>carious</i> tooth.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to relieve the tooth-ach, we must first
endeavour to lessen the flux of humours to the part
affected. This may be done by mild purgatives,
scarifying the gums, or applying leeches to them,
and bathing the feet frequently with warm water.
The perspiration ought likewise to be promoted, by
drinking freely of weak wine-whey, or other diluting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_358'>358</span>liquors, with small doses of nitre. Vomits
too have often an exceeding good effect in the
tooth-ach. It is seldom safe to administer opiates,
or any kind of heating medicines, or even to draw
a tooth, till proper evacuations have been premised;
and these alone will often effect the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>If this fails, and the pain and inflammation still
increase, a suppuration may be expected, to promote
which a toasted fig should be held between
the gum and the cheek; bags filled with boiled camomile-flowers,
flowers of elder, or the like, may
be applied near the part affected, with as great a
degree of warmth as the patient can bear, and renewed
as they grow cool: the patient may likewise
receive the steams of warm water into his mouth,
through an inverted funnel, or by holding his head
over the mouth of a porringer filled with warm water,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such things as promote the discharge of saliva,
or cause the patient to spit, are generally of service.
For this purpose, bitter, hot, or pungent vegetables
may be chewed; as gentian, calamus aromaticus,
or pellitory of Spain. Allen recommends
the root of <i>yellow water flower-de-luce</i> in this case.
This root may either be rubbed upon the tooth, or
a little of it chewed. Brookes says he hardly ever
knew it fail to ease the tooth-ach. It ought however
to be used with caution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many other herbs, roots, and seeds, are recommended
for curing the tooth-ach; as the leaves of
roots of millefoil or yarrow chewed, tobacco
smoked or chewed, staves-acre, or the seeds of
mustard chewed, &#38;c. These bitter, hot, and pungent
things, by occasioning a greater flow of <i>saliva</i>,
frequently give ease in the tooth-ach.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opiates often relieve the tooth-ach. For this
purpose a little cotton wet with laudanum may be
held between the teeth; or a piece of sticking-plaster,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_359'>359</span>about the bigness of a shilling, with a bit
of opium in the middle of it, of a size not to
prevent the sticking of the other, may be laid on
the temporal artery, where the pulsation is most
sensible. <i>De la Motte</i> affirms, that there are few
cases wherein this will not give relief. If there be
a hollow tooth, a small pill made of equal parts of
camphire and opium, put into the hollow, is often
beneficial. When this cannot be had, the hollow
tooth may be filled with gum mastich, wax, lead,
or any substance that will stick in it, and keep out
the external air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few applications give more relief in the tooth-ach
than blistering-plasters. These may be applied
between the shoulders; but they have the best effect
when put behind the ears, and made so large as
to cover a great part of the lower jaw.</p>

<p class='c008'>After all, when a tooth is carious, it is often impossible
to remove the pain without extracting it;
and, as a spoilt tooth never becomes sound again,
it is prudent to draw it soon, lest it should affect
the rest. Tooth-drawing, like bleeding, is very
much practiced by mechanics, as well as persons of
the medical profession. The operation however
is not without danger, and ought always to be performed
with care. A person unacquainted with the
structure of the parts will be in danger of hurting
the jaw-bone, or of drawing a sound tooth instead
of a rotten one<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c010'><sup>[132]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the tooth-ach returns periodically, and the
pain chiefly affects the gums, it may be cured by
the bark.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some pretend to have found great benefit in the
tooth-ach, from the application of an artificial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_360'>360</span>magnet to the affected tooth. We shall not attempt
to account for its mode of operation; but, if it be
found to answer, though only in particular cases,
it certainly deserves a trial, as it is attended with
no expence, and cannot do any harm. Electricity
has likewise been recommended, and particular
instruments have been invented for sending a shock
through the affected tooth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who have returns of the tooth-ach at
certain seasons, as spring and autumn, might often
prevent it by taking a purge at these times.</p>

<p class='c008'>Keeping the teeth clean has no doubt a tendency
to prevent the tooth-ach. The best method of
doing this is to wash them daily with salt and water,
a decoction of the bark, or with cold water
alone. All brushing and scraping of the teeth is
dangerous, and, unless it be performed with great
care, does mischief.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE EAR-ACH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This disorder chiefly affects the membrane which
lines the inner cavity of the ear called the <i>meatus
auditorius</i>. It is often so violent as to occasion
great restlessness, anxiety, and even delirium. Sometimes
epileptic fits, and other convulsive disorders,
have been brought on by extreme pain in the
ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>The ear-ach may proceed from any of the causes
which produce inflammation. It often proceeds
from a sudden suppression of perspiration, or from
the head being exposed to cold when covered with
sweat. It may also be occasioned by worms, or
other insects getting into the ear, or being bred
there; or from any hard body sticking in the ear.
Sometimes it proceeds from the translation of morbific
matter to the ear. This often happens in the
decline of malignant fevers, and occasions deafness,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_361'>361</span>which is generally reckoned a favourable
symptom.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the ear-ach proceeds from insects, or any
hard body sticking in the ear, every method must
be taken to remove them as soon as possible. The
membranes may be relaxed by dropping into the
ear oil of sweet almonds, or olive oil. Afterwards
the patient should be made to sneeze, by taking
snuff, or some strong sternutatory. If this should
not force out the body, it must be extracted by
art. I have seen insects, which had got into the
ear, come out of their own accord upon pouring
in oil, which is a thing they cannot bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the pain of the ear proceeds from inflammation,
it must be treated like other topical inflammations,
by a cooling regimen, and opening medicines.
Bleeding at the beginning, either in the
arm or jugular vein, or cupping in the neck, will
be proper. The ear may likewise be fomented
with steams of warm water; or flannel bags filled
with boiled mallows and camomile flowers may be
applied to it warm; or bladders filled with warm
milk and water. An exceeding good method of
fomenting the ear is to apply it close to the mouth
of a jug filled with warm water, or a strong decoction
of camomile flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient’s feet should be frequently bathed in
lukewarm water, and he ought to take small doses
of nitre and rhubarb, <i>viz.</i> a scruple of the former,
and ten grains of the latter, three times a-day. His
drink may be whey, or decoction of barley and liquorice
with figs or raisins. The parts behind the
ear ought frequently to be rubbed with camphorated
oil, or a little of the volatile liniment.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the inflammation cannot be discussed, a
poultice of bread and milk, or roasted onions, may
be applied to the ear, and frequently renewed, till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_362'>362</span>the abscess breaks, or can be opened. Afterwards
the humours may be diverted from the part by
gentle laxatives, blisters, or issues; but the discharge
must not be suddenly dried up by any external
application.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PAIN OF THE STOMACH, &#38;c.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This may proceed from various causes; as indigestion;
wind; the acrimony of the bile; sharp,
acrid, or poisonous substances taken into the stomach,
&#38;c. It may likewise be occasioned by
worms; the stoppage of customary evacuations;
a translation of gouty matter to the stomach, the
bowels, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women in the decline of life are very liable to
pains of the stomach and bowels, especially such as
are afflicted with hysteric complaints. It is likewise
very common to hypochondriac men of a
sedentary and luxurious life. In such persons it
often proves so extremely obstinate as to baffle all
the powers of medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the pain of the stomach is most violent
after eating, there is reason to suspect that it proceeds
from some fault either in the digestion or the
food. In this case the patient ought to change his
diet, till he finds what kind of food agrees best with
his stomach, and should continue chiefly to use it.
If a change of diet does not remove the complaint,
the patient may take a gentle vomit, and afterwards
a dose or two of rhubarb. He ought likewise
to take an infusion of camomile flowers, or
some other stomachic bitter, either in wine or water.
I have often known exercise remove this complaint,
especially sailing, or a long journey on
horseback, or in a carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_363'>363</span>When a pain of the stomach proceeds from flatulency,
the patient is constantly belching up wind,
and feels an uneasy distention of the stomach after
meals. This is a most deplorable disease, and is
seldom thoroughly cured. In general, the patient
ought to avoid all windy diet, and every thing
that sours on the stomach, as greens, roots, &#38;c.
This rule however admits of some exceptions.
There are many instances of persons very much
troubled with wind, who have received great benefit
from eating parched pease, though that grain
is generally supposed to be of a windy nature<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c010'><sup>[133]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This complaint may likewise be greatly relieved
by labour, especially digging, reaping, mowing,
or any kind of active employment by which the
bowels are alternately compressed and dilated. The
most obstinate case of this kind I ever met with was
in a person of a sedentary occupation, whom I advised,
after he had tried every kind of medicine in
vain, to turn gardener; which he did, and has ever
since enjoyed good health.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a pain of the stomach is occasioned by
the swallowing of acrid or poisonous substances,
they must be discharged by vomit; this may be
excited by butter, oils, or other soft things, which
sheath and defend the stomach from the acrimony
of its contents.</p>

<p class='c008'>When pain of the stomach proceeds from a translation
of gouty matter, warm cordials are necessary,
as generous wines, French brandy, &#38;c. Some
have drank a whole bottle of brandy or rum, in
this case, in a few hours, without being in the least
intoxicated, or even feeling the stomach warmed
by it. It is impossible to ascertain the quantities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_364'>364</span>necessary upon these occasions. This must be
left to the feelings and discretion of the patient.
The safer way however is, not to go too far.
When there is an inclination to vomit, it may be
promoted by drinking an infusion of camomile
flowers, or <i>carduus benedictus</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a pain of the stomach proceed from the stoppage
of customary evacuations, bleeding will be
necessary, especially in sanguine and very full habits.
It will likewise be of use to keep the body gently
open by mild purgatives; as rhubarb or senna, &#38;c.
When this disease affects women, in the decline of
life, after the stoppage of the <i>menses</i>, making an
issue in the leg or arm will be of peculiar service.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is occasioned by worms, they
must be destroyed, or expelled by such means as
are recommended in the following section.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the stomach is greatly relaxed and the digestion
bad, which often occasion flatulencies, the
elixir of vitriol will be of singular service. Fifteen
or twenty drops of it may be taken in a glass of
wine or water twice or thrice a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons afflicted with flatulency are generally unhappy
unless they be taking some purgative medicines;
these, though they may give immediate ease,
tend to weaken and relax the stomach and bowels,
and consequently increase the disorder. Their best
method is to mix purgatives and stomachics together.
Equal parts of Peruvian bark and rhubarb
may be infused in brandy or wine, and taken
in such quantity as to keep the body gently open.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF WORMS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>These are chiefly of three kinds, <i>viz.</i> the
<i>tænia</i>, or tape-worm; the <i>teres</i>, or round and
long worm; and the <i>ascarides</i>, or round and short
worm. There are many other kinds of worms
found in the human body; but as they proceed, in
a great measure, from similar causes, have nearly
the same symptoms, and require almost the same
method of treatment as these already mentioned,
we shall not spend time in enumerating them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The tape-worm is white, very long, and full
of joints. It is generally bred either in the stomach
or small intestines. The round and long worm is
likewise bred in the small guts, and sometimes in the
stomach. The round and short worms commonly
lodge in the <i>rectum</i>, or what is called the end gut,
and occasion a disagreeable itching about the seat.</p>

<p class='c008'>The long round worms occasion squeamishness,
vomiting, a disagreeable breath, gripes, looseness,
swelling of the belly, swoonings, loathing of food,
and at other times a voracious appetite, a dry cough,
convulsions, epileptic fits, and sometimes a privation
of speech. These worms have been known
to perforate the intestines, and get into the cavity
of the belly. The effects of the tape-worm are
nearly the same with those of the long and round,
but rather more violent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Andry says, the following symptoms particularly
attend the <i>solium</i>, which is a species of the tape-worm,
<i>viz.</i> swoonings, privation of speech, and a
voracious appetite. The round worms called <i>ascarides</i>,
besides an itching of the <i>anus</i>, cause swoonings,
and tenesmus, or an inclination to go to stool.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_366'>366</span>CAUSES.——Worms may proceed from various
causes; but they are seldom found except in weak
and relaxed stomachs, where the digestion is bad.
Sedentary persons are more liable to them than the
active and laborious. Those who eat great quantities
of unripe fruit, or who live much on raw
herbs and roots, are generally subject to worms.
There seems to be a hereditary disposition in some
persons to this disease. I have often seen all the
children of a family subject to worms of a particular
kind. They seem likewise frequently to be owing
to the nurse. Children of the same family, nursed
by one woman, have often worms, when those
nursed by another have none.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The common symptoms of
worms are, paleness of the countenance, and at
other times, an universal flushing of the face; itching
of the nose; this however is doubtful, as children
pick their noses in all diseases; starting, and
grinding of the teeth in sleep; swelling of the
upper lip; the appetite sometimes bad, at other
times quite voracious; looseness; a sour or stinking
breath; a hard swelled belly; great thirst; the
urine frothy, and sometimes of a whitish colour;
griping, or colic pains; an involuntary discharge
of <i>saliva</i>, especially when asleep; frequent pains of
the side, with a dry cough, and unequal pulse;
palpitations of the heart; swoonings; drowsiness;
cold sweats; palsy; epileptic fits, with many other
unaccountable nervous symptoms, which were formerly
attributed to witchcraft, or the influence of
evil spirits. Small bodies in the excrements resembling
melon or cucumber seeds are symptoms of
the tape-worm.</p>

<p class='c008'>I lately saw some very surprising effect of worms
in a girl about five years of age, who used to lie for
whole hours as if dead. She at last expired, and,
upon opening her body, a number of the <i>teres</i>, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_367'>367</span>long round worms, were found in her guts, which
were considerably inflamed; and what anatomists
call an <i>intus susceptio</i>, or involving of one part of
the gut within another, had taken place in no less
than four different parts of the intestinal canal<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c010'><sup>[134]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Though numberless medicines
are extolled for expelling and killing worms<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c010'><sup>[135]</sup></a>, yet
no disease more frequently baffles the physician’s
skill. In general, the most proper medicines for
their expulsion are strong purgatives; and to prevent
their breeding, stomachic bitters, with now
and then a glass of good wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best purge for an adult is jalap and calomel.
Five and twenty or thirty grains of the former with
six or seven of the latter, mixed in syrup, may be
taken early in the morning, for a dose. It will be
proper that the patient keep the house all day, and
drink nothing cold. The dose may be repeated
once or twice a week, for a fortnight or three
weeks. On the intermediate days the patient may
take a drachm of the powder of tin, twice or thrice
a-day, mixed with syrup, honey, or treacle.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who do not chuse to take calomel may
make use of the bitter purgatives; as aloes, hiera
picra, tincture of senna, and rhubarb, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Oily medicines are sometimes found beneficial
for expelling worms. An ounce of sallad oil and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_368'>368</span>a table-spoonful of common salt may be taken in a
glass of red port wine thrice a-day, or oftner, if
the stomach will bear it. But the more common
form of using oil is in clysters. Oily clysters,
sweetened with sugar or honey, are very efficacious
in bringing away the short round worms called
<i>ascarides</i>, and likewise the <i>teres</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Harrowgate water is an excellent medicine
for expelling worms, especially the <i>ascarides</i>. As
this water is impregnated with sulphur, we may
hence infer, that sulphur alone must be a good
medicine in this case; which is found to be a fact.
Many practitioners give flour of sulphur in very
large doses, and with great success. It should be
made into an electuary with honey or treacle, and
taken in such quantity as to purge the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where Harrowgate water cannot be obtained,
sea-water may be used, which is far from being a
contemptible medicine in this case. If sea-water
cannot be had, common salt dissolved in water may
be drank. I have often seen this used by country
nurses with very good effect. Some flour of sulphur
may be taken over night, and the salt-water in the
morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>But worms, though expelled, will soon breed
again, if the stomach remains weak and relaxed;
to prevent which, we would recommend the Peruvian
bark. Half a drachm of bark in powder may
be taken in a glass of red port wine three or four
times a-day, after the above medicines have been
used. Lime-water is likewise good for this purpose,
or a table-spoonful of the chalybeate wine
taken twice or thrice a-day. Infusions or decoctions
of bitter herbs may likewise be drank; as the
infusion of tansy, water-trefoil, camomile flowers,
tops of wormwood, the lesser centaury, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>For a child of four or five years old, six grains
of rhubarb, five of jalap, and two of calomel, may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_369'>369</span>be mixed in a spoonful of syrup or honey, and
given in the morning. The child should keep the
house all day, and take nothing cold. This dose
may be repeated twice a-week for three or four
weeks. On the intermediate days the child may
take a scruple of powdered tin and ten grains of
æthiops mineral in a spoonful of treacle twice a-day.
This dose must be increased or diminished according
to the age of the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bisset says, the great bastard black hellebore, or
<i>bear’s foot</i>, is a most powerful vermifuge for the
long round worms. He orders the decoction of
about a drachm of the green leaves, or about fifteen
grains of the dried leaves in powder for a dose
to a child between four and seven years of age.
This dose is to be repeated two or three times.
He adds, that the green leaves made into a syrup
with coarse sugar, is almost the only medicine he
has used for round worms for three years past.
Before pressing out the juice, he moistens the bruised
leaves with vinegar, which corrects the medicine.
The dose is a tea-spoonful at bed-time, and
one or two next morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have frequently known those big bellies, which
in children are commonly reckoned a sign of worms,
quite removed by giving them white soap in their
pottage, or other food. Tansy, garlic, and rue,
are all good against worms, and may be used various
ways. We might here mention many other
plants, both for external and internal use, as the
cabbage-bark, &#38;c. but think the powder of tin
with æthiops mineral, and the purges of rhubarb
and calomel, are more to be depended on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ball’s purging vermifuge powder is a very powerful
medicine. It is made of equal parts of rhubarb,
seammony, and calomel, with as much double
refined sugar as is equal to the weight of all the
other ingredients. These must be well mixed together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_370'>370</span>and reduced to a fine powder. The dose
for a child is from ten grains to twenty, once or
twice a-week. An adult may take a drachm for
a dose<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c010'><sup>[136]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Parents who would preserve their children from
worms ought to allow them plenty of exercise in the
open air; to take care that their food be wholesome
and sufficiently solid; and, as far as possible, to
prevent their eating raw herbs, roots, or green
trashy fruits. It will not be amiss to allow a child
who is subject to worms, a glass of red wine after
meals; as every thing that braces and strengthens
the stomach is good both for preventing and expelling
these vermin<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c010'><sup>[137]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXVI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE JAUNDICE.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This disease is first observable in the white of
the eye, which appears yellow. Afterwards
the whole skin puts on a yellow appearance. The
urine too is of a saffron hue, and dies a white cloth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_371'>371</span>of the same colour. There is likewise a species of
this disease called the Black Jaundice.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The immediate cause of the jaundice
is an obstruction of the bile. The remote or
occasional causes are, the bites of poisonous animals,
as the viper, mad dog, &#38;c. the bilious or
hysteric colic; violent passions, as grief, anger, &#38;c.
Strong purges or vomits will likewise occasion the
jaundice. Sometimes it proceeds from obstinate
agues, or from that disease being prematurely stopped
by astringent medicines. In infants it is often
occasioned by the <i>meconium</i> not being sufficiently
purged off. Pregnant women are very subject
to it. It is likewise a symptom in several kinds
of fever. Catching cold, or the stoppage of customary
evacuations, as the <i>menses</i>, the bleeding piles,
issues, &#38;c. will occasion the jaundice.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The patient at first complains
of excessive weariness, and has great aversion
to every kind of motion. His skin is dry, and
he generally feels a kind of itching or pricking
pain over the whole body. The stools are of a
whitish or clay colour, and the urine, as was observed
above, is yellow. The breathing is difficult,
and the patient complains of an unusual load
or oppression on his breast. There is a heat in the
nostrils, a bitter taste in the mouth, loathing of
food, sickness at the stomach, vomiting, flatulency,
and other symptoms of indigestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient be young, and the disease complicated
with no other malady, it is seldom dangerous;
but in old people, where it continues long, returns
frequently, or is complicated with the dropsy or
hypochondriac symptoms, it generally proves fatal.
The black jaundice is more dangerous than the
yellow.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The diet should be cool, light,
and diluting, consisting chiefly of ripe fruits and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_372'>372</span>mild vegetables; as apples boiled or roasted, stewed
prunes, preserved plums, boiled spinage, &#38;c. Veal
or chicken-broth, with light bread, are likewise
very proper. Many have been cured by living almost
wholly for some days on raw eggs. The
drink should be butter-milk, whey sweetened with
honey, or decoctions of cool opening vegetables;
or marsh-mallow roots, with liquorice, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should take as much exercise as he
can bear, either on horseback, or in a carriage;
walking, running, and even jumping, are likewise
proper, provided he can bear them without pain,
and there be no symptoms of inflammation. Patients
have been often cured of this disease by a long
journey, after medicines had proved ineffectual.</p>

<p class='c008'>Amusements are likewise of great use in the jaundice.
The disease is often occasioned by a sedentary
life, joined to a dull melancholy disposition.
Whatever therefore tends to promote the circulation,
and to cheer the spirits, must have a good
effect; as dancing, laughing, singing, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——If the patient be young, of a
full sanguine habit, and complains of pain in the
right side about the region of the liver, bleeding
will be necessary. After this a vomit must be administered,
and if the disease proves obstinate, it
may be repeated once or twice. No medicines
are more beneficial in the jaundice than vomits,
especially where it is not attended with inflammation.
Half a drachm of ipecacuanha in powder
will be a sufficient dose for an adult. It may be
wrought off with weak camomile-tea, or lukewarm
water. The body must likewise be kept open by
taking a sufficient quantity of Castile soap, or the
pills for the jaundice recommended in the Appendix.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fomenting the parts about the region of the stomach
and liver, and rubbing them with a warm
<span class='pageno' id='Page_373'>373</span>hand or flesh-brush, are likewise beneficial; but it
is still more so for the patient to sit in a bath of
warm water up to the breast. He ought to do this
frequently, and should continue in it as long as his
strength will permit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many dirty things are recommended for the cure
of the jaundice; as lice, millepedes, &#38;c. But these
do more harm than good, as people trust to them,
and neglect more valuable medicines; besides,
they are seldom taken in sufficient quantity to produce
any effects. People always expect that such
<i>things</i> should act as charms, and consequently seldom
persist in the use of them. Vomits, purges,
fomentations, and exercise, will seldom fail to cure
the jaundice when it is a simple disease; and when
complicated with the dropsy, a scirrhous liver, or
other chronic complaints, it is hardly to be cured
by any means.</p>

<p class='c008'>Numberless British herbs are extolled for the
cure of this disease. The author of the <i>Medicina
Britannica</i> mentions near a hundred, all famous for
curing the jaundice. The fact is, the disease often
goes off of its own accord; in which case the last
medicine is always said to have performed the cure.
I have sometimes however seen considerable benefit,
in a very obstinate jaundice, from a decoction of
hempseed. Four ounces of the seed may be boiled
in two English quarts of ale, and sweetened with
coarse sugar. The dose is half an English pint
every morning. It may be continued for eight or
nine days.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have likewise known Harrowgate sulphur-water
cure a jaundice of very long standing. It
should be used for some weeks, and the patient
must both drink and bathe.</p>

<p class='c008'>The soluble tartar is a very proper medicine in
the jaundice. A drachm of it may be taken every
night and morning in a cup of tea or water-gruel.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_374'>374</span>If it does not open the body, the dose may be
increased.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons subject to the jaundice ought to take as
much exercise as possible, and to avoid all heating
and astringent aliments.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXVII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE DROPSY.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The dropsy is a preternatural swelling of the
whole body, or some part of it, occasioned by
a collection of watery humour. It is distinguished
by different names, according to the part affected,
as the <i>anasarca</i>, or a collection of water under the
skin; the <i>ascites</i>, or a collection of water in the
belly; the <i>hydrops pectoris</i>, or dropsy of the breast;
the <i>hydrocephalus</i>, or dropsy of the brain, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The dropsy is often owing to an
hereditary disposition. It may likewise proceed
from drinking ardent spirits, or other strong liquors.
It is true almost to a proverb, that great
drinkers die of a dropsy. The want of exercise is
also a very common cause of the dropsy. Hence
it is justly reckoned among the diseases of the sedentary.
It often proceeds from excessive evacuations,
as frequent and copious bleedings, strong
purges often repeated, frequent salivations, &#38;c.
The sudden stoppage of customary or necessary
evacuations, as the <i>menses</i>, the hæmorrhoids, fluxes
of the belly, &#38;c. may likewise cause a dropsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have known the dropsy occasioned by drinking
large quantities of cold, weak, watery liquor, when
the body was heated by violent exercise. A low,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_375'>375</span>damp, or marshy situation is likewise a frequent
cause of it. Hence it is a common disease in
moist, flat, fenny countries. It may also be
brought on by a long use of poor watery diet, or
of viscous aliment that is hard of digestion. It is
often the effect of other diseases, as the jaundice, a
scirrhus of the liver, a violent ague of long continuance,
a diarrhœa, a dysentery, an empyema,
or a consumption of the lungs. In short, whatever
obstructs the perspiration, or prevents the
blood from being duly prepared, may occasion a
dropsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The <i>anasarca</i> generally begins
with a swelling of the feet and ancles towards
night, which for some time disappears in the
morning. In the evening the parts, if pressed
with the finger, will pit. The swelling gradually
ascends, and occupies the trunk of the body, the
arms, and the head. Afterwards the breathing
becomes difficult, the urine is in small quantity,
and the thirst great; the body is bound, and the
perspiration is greatly obstructed. To these succeed
torpor, heaviness, a slow wasting fever, and
a troublesome cough. This last is generally a fatal
symptom, as it shews that the lungs are affected.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an <i>ascites</i>, besides the above symptoms, there
is a swelling of the belly, and often a fluctuation,
which may be perceived by striking the belly on
one side, and laying the palm of the hand on the
opposite. This may be distinguished from a <i>tympany</i>
by the weight of the swelling, as well as by
the fluctuation. When the <i>anasarca</i> and <i>ascites</i> are
combined, the case is very dangerous. Even a
simple <i>ascites</i> seldom admits of a radical cure. Almost
all that can be done is, to let off the water
by tapping, which seldom affords more than a
temporary relief.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_376'>376</span>When the disease comes suddenly on, and the
patient is young and strong, there is reason however
to hope for a cure, especially if medicine be
given early. But if the patient be old, has led an
irregular or a sedentary life, or if there be reason
to suspect that the liver, lungs, or any of the viscera
are unsound, there is great reason to fear that
the consequences will prove fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The patient must abstain, as
much as possible, from all drink, especially weak
and watery liquors, and must quench his thirst with
mustard-whey, or acids, as juice of lemons, oranges,
sorrel, or such like. His aliment ought to be dry,
of a stimulating and diuretic quality, as toasted
bread, the flesh of birds, or other wild animals
roasted; pungent and aromatic vegetables, as garlic,
mustard, onions, cresses, horse-radish, rocambole,
shalot, &#38;c. He may also eat sea-biscuit dipt
in wine or a little brandy. This is not only nourishing,
but tends to quench thirst. Some have
been actually cured of a dropsy by a total abstinence
from all liquids, and living entirely upon
such things as are mentioned above. If the patient
must have drink, the Spa-water, or Rhenish
wine, with diuretic medicines infused in it, are the
best.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise is of the greatest importance in a dropsy.
If the patient be able to walk, dig, or the like, he
ought to continue these exercises as long as he
can. If he is not able to walk or labour, he must
ride on horseback, or in a carriage, and the more
violent the motion so much the better, provided he
can bear it. His bed ought to be hard, and the
air of his apartments warm and dry. If he lives
in a damp country, he ought to be removed into a
dry one, and, if possible, into a warmer climate.
In a word, every method should be taken to promote
the perspiration, and to brace the solids. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_377'>377</span>this purpose it will likewise be proper to rub the
patient’s body, two or three times a day, with a
hard cloth, or the flesh-brush; and he ought constantly
to wear flannel next his skin.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——If the patient be young, his
constitution good, and the disease has come on suddenly,
it may generally be removed by strong vomits,
brisk purges, and such medicines as promote
a discharge by sweat and urine. For an adult, half
a drachm of ipecacuanha in powder, and half an
ounce of oxymel of squills, will be a proper vomit.
This may be repeated as often as is found
necessary, three or four days intervening between
the doses. The patient must not drink much after
taking the vomit, otherwise he destroys its effect.
A cup or two of camomile-tea will be sufficient to
work it off.</p>

<p class='c008'>Between each vomit, on one of the intermediate
days, the patient may take the following purge:
Jalap in powder half a drachm, cream of tartar,
two drachms, calomel six grains. These may be
made into a bolus with a little syrup of pale roses,
and taken early in the morning. The less the patient
drinks after it the better. If he be much
griped, he may now and then take a cup of chicken-broth.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient may likewise take every night at
bed-time the following bolus: To four or five grains
of camphor add one grain of opium, and as much
syrup of orange-peel as is sufficient to make them
into a bolus. This will generally promote a gentle
sweat, which should be encouraged by drinking
now and then a small cup of wine-whey, with a
tea-spoonful of the spirits of hartshorn in it. A
tea-cupful of the following diuretic infusion may
likewise be taken every four or five hours through
the day:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_378'>378</span>Take juniper-berries, mustard-seed, and horse-radish,
of each half an ounce, ashes of broom half
a pound; infuse them in a quart of Rhenish wine or
strong ale for a few days, and afterwards strain off
the liquor. Such as cannot take this infusion, may
use the decoction of seneka-root, which is both
diuretic and sudorific. I have known an obstinate
<i>anasarca</i> cured by an infusion of the ashes of broom
in wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above course will often cure an incidental
dropsy, if the constitution be good; but when the
disease proceeds from a bad habit, or an unsound
state of the viscera, strong purges and vomits are
not to be ventured upon. In this case, the safer
course is to palliate the symptoms by the use of
such medicines as promote the secretions, and to
support the patient’s strength by warm and nourishing
cordials.</p>

<p class='c008'>The secretion of urine may be greatly promoted
by nitre. Brookes says, he knew a young woman
who was cured of a dropsy by taking a drachm of
nitre every morning in a draught of ale, after she
had been given over as incurable. The powder of
squills is likewise a good diuretic. Six or eight
grains of it, with a scruple of nitre, may be given
twice a-day in a glass of strong cinnamon-water.
Ball says, a large spoonful of unbruised mustard-seed
taken every night and morning, and drinking
half an English pint of the decoction of the tops
of green broom after it, has performed a cure
after other powerful medicines had proved ineffectual.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have sometimes seen good effects from cream of
tartar in this disease. It promotes the discharges
by stool and urine, and will at least palliate, if it
does not perform a cure. The patient may begin
by taking an ounce every second or third day, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_379'>379</span>may increase the quantity to two or even to three
ounces, if the stomach will bear it. This quantity
is not however to be taken at once, but divided
into three or four doses.</p>

<p class='c008'>To promote perspiration, the patient may use the
decoction of seneka-root, as directed above; or he
may take two table-spoonfuls of Mindererus’s spirit
in a cup of wine-whey three or four times a-day.
To promote a discharge of urine, the following infusion
of the London hospitals will likewise be
beneficial:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of zedoary-root two drachms; dried squills,
rhubarb, and juniper-berries bruised, of each a
drachm; cinnamon in powder, three drachms;
salt of wormwood, a drachm and a half; infuse in
an English pint and a half of old hock-wine, and
when fit for use, filter the liquor. A wine-glass of
it may be taken three or four times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the <i>anasarca</i> it is usual to scarify the feet and
legs. By this means the water is often discharged;
but the operator must be cautious not to make the
incisions too deep; they ought barely to pierce
through the skin, and especial care must be taken,
by spirituous fomentations and proper digestives, to
prevent a gangrene.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an <i>ascites</i>, when the disease does not evidently
and speedily give way to purgative and diuretic
medicines, the water ought to be let off by tapping.
This is a very simple and safe operation,
and would often succeed, if it were performed in
due time; but if it be delayed till the humours
are vitiated, or the bowels spoiled, by long soaking
in water, it can hardly be expected that any permanent
relief will be procured<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c010'><sup>[138]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_380'>380</span>After the evacuation of the water, the patient is
to be put on a course of strengthening medicines;
as the Peruvian bark; the elixir of vitriol; warm
aromatics, with a due proportion of rhubarb, infused
in wine, and such like. His diet ought to
be dry and nourishing, such as is recommended in
the beginning of the Chapter; and he should take
as much exercise as he can bear without fatigue.
He should wear flannel next his skin, and make
daily use of the flesh-brush.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXVIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE GOUT.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There is no disease which shews the imperfection
of medicine, or sets the advantages of
temperance and exercise in a stronger light, than
the gout. Excess and idleness are the true sources
from whence it originally sprung, and all who
would avoid it must be <i>active</i> and <i>temperate</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though idleness and intemperance are the principal
causes of the gout, yet many other things
may contribute to bring on the disorder in those
who are not, and to induce a paroxysm in those
who are subject to it; as intense study; too free an
use of acidulated liquors; night-watching; grief
or uneasiness of mind; an obstruction or defect of
any of the customary discharges, as the <i>menses</i>,
sweating of the feet, perspiration, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_381'>381</span>SYMPTOMS.——A fit of the gout is generally
preceded by indigestion, drowsiness, belching of
wind, a slight head-ach, sickness, and sometimes
vomiting. The patient complains of weariness and
dejection of spirits, and has often a pain in the
limbs, with a sensation as if wind or cold water
were passing down the thigh. The appetite is often
remarkably keen a day or two before the fit, and
there is a slight pain in passing urine, and sometimes
an involuntary shedding of tears. Sometimes
these symptoms are much more violent, especially
upon the near approach of the fit; and some observe,
that as is the fever which ushers in the gout,
so will the fit be; if the fever be short and sharp,
the fit will be so likewise; if it be feeble, long, and
lingering, the fit will be such also. But this observation
can only hold with respect to very regular
fits of the gout.</p>

<p class='c008'>The regular gout generally makes its attack in
the spring, or beginning of winter, in the following
manner: About two or three in the morning,
the patient is seized with a pain in his great toe,
sometimes in the heel, and at other times in the
ancle or calf of the leg. This pain is accompanied
with a sensation as if cold water were poured
upon the part, which is succeeded by a shivering,
with some degree of fever. Afterwards the pain
increases, and fixing among the small bones of the
foot, the patient feels all the different kinds of torture,
as if the part were stretched, burnt, squeezed,
gnawed, or torn in pieces, &#38;c. The part at length
becomes so exquisitely sensible, that the patient
cannot bear to have it touched, or even suffer any
person to walk across the room.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient is generally in exquisite torture for
twenty-four hours, from the time of the coming on
of the fit: he then becomes easier, the part begins
<span class='pageno' id='Page_382'>382</span>to swell, appears red, and is covered with a little
moisture. Towards morning he drops asleep, and
generally falls into a gentle breathing sweat. This
terminates the first paroxysm, a number of which
constitutes a fit of the gout; which is longer or
shorter according to the patient’s age, strength, the
season of the year, and the disposition of the body
to this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient is always worse towards night, and
easier in the morning. The paroxysms however
generally grow milder every day, till at length the
disease is carried off by perspiration, urine, and
the other evacuations. In some patients this happens
in a few days; in others, it requires weeks,
and in some, months, to finish the fit. Those
whom age and frequent fits of the gout have
greatly debilitated, seldom get free from it before
the approach of summer, and sometimes not till it
be pretty far advanced.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——As there are no medicines yet
known that will cure the gout, we shall confine our
observations chiefly to regimen, both in and out of
the fit.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the fit, if the patient be young and strong,
his diet ought to be thin and cooling, and his drink
of a diluting nature; but where the constitution is
weak, and the patient has been accustomed to live
high, this is not a proper time to retrench. In
this case he must keep nearly to his usual diet, and
should take frequently a cup of strong negus, or a
glass of generous wine. Wine-whey is a very
proper drink in this case, as it promotes the perspiration
without greatly heating the patient. It
will answer this purpose better if a tea-spoonful
of <i>sal volatile oleosum</i>, or spirits of hartshorn, be
put into a cup of it twice a-day. It will likewise
be proper to give at bed-time a tea-spoonful of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_383'>383</span>volatile tincture of <i>guaiacum</i> in a large draught of
warm wine-whey. This will greatly promote perspiration
through the night.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the most safe and efficacious method of discharging
the gouty matter is by perspiration, this
ought to be kept up by all means, especially in the
affected part. For this purpose the leg and foot
should be wrapt in soft flannel, fur, or wool. The
last is most readily obtained, and seems to answer
the purpose better than any thing else. The people
of Lancashire look upon wool as a kind of
specific in the gout. They wrap a great quantity
of it about the leg and foot affected, and cover it
with a skin of soft dressed leather. This they suffer
to continue for eight or ten days, and sometimes
for a fortnight or three weeks, or longer, if the pain
does not cease. I never knew any external application
answer so well in the gout. I have often
seen it applied when the swelling and inflammation
were very great, with violent pain, and have found
all these symptoms relieved by it in a few days.
The wool which they use is generally greased, and
carded or combed. They chuse the softest which
can be had, and seldom or never remove it till the
fit be entirely gone off.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient ought likewise to be kept quiet and
easy during the fit. Every thing that affects the
mind disturbs the paroxysm, and tends to throw the
gout upon the nobler parts. All external applications
that repel the matter are to be avoided as
death. They do not cure the disease, but remove
it from a safer to a more dangerous part of the
body, where it often proves fatal. A fit of the
gout is to be considered as Nature’s method of removing
something that might prove destructive to
the body, and all that we can do, with safety, is to
promote her intentions, and to assist her in expelling
the enemy in her own way. Evacuations by bleeding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_384'>384</span>stool, &#38;c. are likewise to be used with caution;
they do not remove the cause of the disease,
and sometimes by weakening the patient prolong
the fit: but where the constitution is able to bear
it, it will be of use to keep the body gently open
by diet, or very mild laxative medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many things will indeed shorten a fit of the gout,
and some will drive it off altogether: but nothing
has yet been found which will do this with safety to
the patient. In pain we eagerly grasp at any thing
that promises immediate ease, and even hazard life
itself for a temporary relief. This is the true reason
why so many infallible remedies have been
proposed for the gout, and why such numbers have
lost their lives by the use of them. It would be
as prudent to stop the small-pox from rising, and to
drive them into the blood, as to attempt to repel
the gouty matter after it has been thrown upon
the extremities. The latter is as much an effort
of Nature to free herself from an offending cause
as the former, and ought equally to be promoted.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the pain however is very great, and the
patient is restless, thirty or forty drops of laudanum,
more or less, according to the violence of the
symptoms, may be taken at bed-time. This will
ease the pain, procure rest, promote perspiration,
and forward the crisis of the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the fit is over, the patient ought to take a
gentle dose or two of the bitter tincture of rhubarb,
or some other warm stomachic purge. He
should also drink a weak infusion of stomachic bitters
in small wine or ale, as the Peruvian bark,
with cinnamon, Virginian snake-root, and orange-peel.
The diet at this time should be light, but
nourishing, and gentle exercise ought to be taken
on horseback, or in a carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_385'>385</span>Out of the fit, it is in the patient’s power to do
many things towards preventing a return of the disorder,
or rendering the fit, if it should return, less
severe. This however is not to be attempted by
medicine. I have frequently known the gout kept
off for several years by the Peruvian bark and other
astringent medicines; but in all the cases where I had
occasion to see this tried, the persons died suddenly,
and, to all appearance, for want of a regular
fit of the gout. One would be apt, from
hence, to conclude, that a fit of the gout, to some
constitutions, in the decline of life, is rather salutary
than hurtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though it may be dangerous to stop a fit of the
gout by medicine, yet if the constitution can be
so changed by diet and exercise, as to lessen or totally
prevent its return, there certainly can be no
danger in following such a course. It is well known
that the whole habit may be so altered by a proper
regimen, as quite to eradicate this disease; and
those only who have sufficient resolution to persist in
such a course have reason to expect a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The course which we would recommend for preventing
the gout, is as follows: In the first place,
<i>universal temperance</i>. In the next place <i>sufficient exercise</i><a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c010'><sup>[139]</sup></a>.
By this we do not mean sauntering about in
an indolent manner, but labour, sweat, and toil.
These only can render the humours wholesome, and
keep them so. Going early to bed, and rising betimes,
are also of great importance. It is likewise
proper to avoid night studies, and all intense
thought. The supper should be light, and taken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_386'>386</span>early. All strong liquors, especially generous
wines and sour punch, are to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>We would likewise recommend some doses of
<i>magnesia alba</i> and rhubarb to be taken every spring
and autumn; and afterwards a course of stomachic
bitters, as tansey or water-trefoil tea, an infusion
of gentian and camomile flowers, or a decoction
of burdock root, &#38;c. Any of these, or an infusion
of any wholesome bitter that is more agreeable
to the patient, may be drank for two or three
weeks in March and October twice a-day. An
issue or perpetual blister has a great tendency to
prevent the gout. If these were more generally
used in the decline of life, they would not only
often prevent the gout, but also other chronic maladies.
Such as can afford to go to Bath, will find
great benefit from bathing and drinking the water.
It both promotes digestion, and invigorates
the habit.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though there is little room for medicine during
a regular fit of the gout, yet when it leaves the extremities,
and falls on some of the internal parts,
proper applications to recal and fix it become absolutely
necessary. When the gout affects the head,
the pain of the joints ceases, and the swelling disappears,
while either severe head-ach, drowsiness,
trembling, giddiness, convulsions, or delirium come
on. When it seizes the lungs, great oppression,
with cough and difficulty of breathing, ensue. If
it attacks the stomach, extreme sickness, vomiting,
anxiety, pain in the epigastric region, and total loss
of strength, will succeed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the gout attacks the head or lungs, every
method must be taken to fix it in the feet. They
must be frequently bathed in warm water, and acrid
cataplasms applied to the soles. Blistering-plasters
ought likewise to be applied to the ancles or calves
<span class='pageno' id='Page_387'>387</span>of the legs. Bleeding in the feet or ancles is also
necessary, and warm stomachic purges. The patient
ought to keep in bed for the most part, if
there be any signs of inflammation, and should be
very careful not to catch cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it attacks the stomach with a sense of cold, the
most warm cordials are necessary; as strong wine
boiled up with cinnamon or other spices; cinnamon-water;
peppermint-water; and even brandy
or rum. The patient should keep his bed, and
endeavour to promote a sweat by drinking warm liquors;
and if he should be troubled with a nausea,
or inclination to vomit, he may drink camomile-tea,
or any thing that will make him vomit
freely.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the gout attacks the kidneys, and imitates
gravel-pains, the patient ought to drink freely
of a decoction of marsh-mallows, and to have the
parts fomented with warm water. An emollient
clyster ought likewise to be given, and afterwards
an opiate. If the pain be very violent, twenty or
thirty drops of laudanum may be taken in a cup of
the decoction.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who have had the gout should be very
attentive to any complaints that may happen to
them about the time when they have reason to expect
a return of the fit. The gout imitates many
other disorders, and by being mistaken for them,
and treated improperly, is often diverted from
its regular course, to the great danger of the patient’s
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who never had the gout, but who, from
their constitution or manner of living, have reason
to expect it, ought likewise to be very circumspect
with regard to its first approach. If the disease,
by wrong conduct or improper medicines, be
diverted from its proper course, the miserable patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_388'>388</span>has a chance to be ever after tormented with
head-achs, coughs, pains of the stomach and intestines;
and to fall at last a victim to its attack
upon some of the more noble parts.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE RHEUMATISM.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This disease has often a resemblance to the gout.
It generally attacks the joints with exquisite pain,
and is sometimes attended with inflammation and
swelling. It is most common in the spring, and
towards the end of autumn. It is usually distinguished
into acute and chronic; or the rheumatism
with and without a fever.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The causes of a rheumatism are
frequently the same as those of an inflammatory fever,
<i>viz.</i> an obstructed perspiration, the immoderate
use of strong liquors, and the like. Sudden
changes of the weather, and all quick transitions
from heat to cold, are very apt to occasion the rheumatism.
The most extraordinary case of a rheumatism
that I ever saw, where almost every joint
of the body was distorted, was a man who used to
work one part of the day by the fire, and the other
part of it in the water. Very obstinate rheumatisms
have likewise been brought on by persons not
accustomed to it, allowing their feet to continue
long wet. The same effects are often produced by
wet clothes, damp beds, sitting or lying on the
damp ground, travelling in the night, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rheumatism may likewise be occasioned by
excessive evacuations, or the stoppage of customary
discharges. It is often the effect of chronic diseases,
which vitiate the humours; as the scurvy,
the <i>lues venerea</i>, obstinate autumnal agues, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The rheumatism prevails in cold, damp, marshy
countries. It is most common among the poorer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_389'>389</span>sort of peasants, who are ill clothed, live in low
damp houses, and eat coarse unwholesome food,
which contains but little nourishment, and is not
easily digested.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——The <i>acute</i> rheumatism commonly
begins with weariness, shivering, a quick
pulse, restlessness, thirst, and other symptoms of
fever. Afterwards the patient complains of flying
pains, which are increased by the least motion.
These at length fix in the joints, which are often
affected with swelling and inflammation. If blood
be let in this disease, it has generally the same appearance
as in the pleurisy.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this kind of rheumatism the treatment of the
patient is nearly the same as in an acute or inflammatory
fever. If he be young and strong, bleeding
is necessary, which may be repeated according to
the exigencies of the case. The body ought likewise
to be kept open by emollient clysters, or cool
opening liquors; as decoctions of tamarinds, cream
of tartar whey, senna-tea, and the like. The diet
should be light, and in small quantity, consisting
chiefly of roasted apples, groat-gruel, or weak
chicken-broth. After the feverish symptoms have
abated, if the pain still continues, the patient must
keep his bed, and take such things as promote perspiration;
as wine-whey, with <i>spiritus Mindereri</i>, &#38;c.
He may likewise take, for a few nights, at bed-time,
in a cup of wine-whey, a drachm of the cream
of tartar, and half a drachm of gum guaiacum in
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Warm bathing, after proper evacuations, has
often an exceeding good effect. The patient may
either be put into a bath of warm water, or have
cloths wrung out of it applied to the parts affected.
Great care must be taken that he do not catch cold
after bathing.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_390'>390</span>The <i>chronic</i> rheumatism is seldom attended with
any considerable degree of fever, and is generally
confined to some particular part of the body, as the
shoulders, the back, or the loins. There is seldom
any inflammation or swelling in this case. Persons
in the decline of life are most subject to the chronic
rheumatism. In such patients it often proves extremely
obstinate, and sometimes incurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this kind of rheumatism the regimen should
be nearly the same as in the acute. Cool and diluting
diet, consisting chiefly of vegetable substances,
as stewed prunes, coddled apples, currants
or gooseberries boiled in milk, is most proper.
Arbuthnot says, “If there be a specific in aliment
for the rheumatism, it is certainly whey,” and
adds, “That he knew a person subject to this disease,
who could never be cured by any other method
but a diet of whey and bread.” He likewise
says, “That cream of tartar in water-gruel, taken
for several days, will ease rheumatic pains considerably.”
This I have often experienced, but found
it always more efficacious when joined with gum
guaiacum, as already directed. In this case the
patient may take the dose formerly mentioned
twice a-day, and likewise a tea-spoonful of the volatile
tincture of gum guaiacum, at bed-time, in
wine-whey.</p>

<p class='c008'>This course may be continued for a week, or
longer, if the case proves obstinate, and the patient’s
strength will permit. It ought then to be
omitted for a few days, and repeated again. At
the same time leeches or a blistering-plaster may
be applied to the part affected. What I have generally
found answer better than either of these, in
obstinate fixed rheumatic pains, is the <i>warm plaster</i><a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c010'><sup>[140]</sup></a>.
I have likewise known a plaster of Burgundy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_391'>391</span>pitch worn for some time on the part
affected give great relief in rheumatic pains. My
ingenious friend, Dr. Alexander of Edinburgh,
says, he has frequently cured very obstinate rheumatic
pains by rubbing the part affected with tincture
of cantharides. When the common tincture
did not succeed, he used it of a double or treble
strength. Cupping upon the part affected is likewise
often very beneficial, and is greatly preferable
to the application of leeches.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though this disease may not seem to yield to
medicines for some time, yet they ought still to be
persisted in. Persons who are subject to frequent
returns of the rheumatism, will often find their account
in using medicines, whether they be immediately
affected with the disease or not. The chronic
rheumatism is similar to the gout in this respect,
that the most proper time for using medicines to
extirpate it, is when the patient is most free from
the disorder.</p>

<p class='c008'>To those who can afford the expence, I would
recommend the warm baths of Buxton or Matlock
in Derbyshire. These have often, to my knowledge,
cured very obstinate rheumatisms, and are
always safe either in or out of the fit. When the
rheumatism is complicated with scorbutic complaints,
which is not seldom the case, the Harrowgate
waters, and those of Moffat, are proper.
They should both be drank and used as a warm
bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>There are several of our own domestic plants
which may be used with advantage in the rheumatism.
One of the best is the white <i>mustard</i>. A
table-spoonful of the seed of this plant may be
taken twice or thrice a-day, in a glass of water or
small wine. The water-trefoil is likewise of great
use in this complaint. It may be infused in wine
or ale, or drank in form of tea. The ground-ivy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_392'>392</span>camomile, and several other bitters, are also beneficial,
and may be used in the same manner. No
benefit however is to be expected from these, unless
they be taken for a considerable time. Excellent
medicines are often despised in this disease, because
they do not perform an immediate cure;
whereas nothing would be more certain than their
effect, were they duly persisted in. Want of perseverance
in the use of medicines is one reason why
chronic diseases are so seldom cured.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cold bathing, especially in salt-water, often cures
the rheumatism. We would also recommend riding
on horseback, and wearing flannel next the skin.
Issues are likewise very proper, especially in chronic
cases. If the pain affects the shoulders, an issue
may be made in the arm; but if it affects the loins,
it should be put into the leg or thigh.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons afflicted with the scurvy are very subject
to rheumatic complaints. The best medicines in
this case are bitters and mild purgatives. These
may either be taken separately or together, as the
patient inclines. An ounce of Peruvian bark, and
half an ounce of rhubarb in powder, may be infused
in a bottle of wine; and one, two, or three
wine glasses of it taken daily, as shall be found necessary
for keeping the body gently open. In cases
where the bark itself proves sufficiently purgative,
the rhubarb may be omitted.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as are subject to frequent attacks of the
rheumatism ought to make choice of a dry, warm
situation, to avoid the night-air, wet clothes, and
wet feet, as much as possible. Their clothing
should be warm, and they should wear flannel
next their skin, and make frequent use of the flesh-brush.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_393'>393</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XXXIX.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE SCURVY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>This disease prevails chiefly in cold northern
countries, especially in low damp situations,
near large marshes, or great quantities of stagnating
water. Sedentary people, of a dull melancholy
disposition, are most subject to it. It proves often
fatal to sailors on long voyages, particularly in ships
that are not properly ventilated, have many people
on board, or where cleanliness is neglected.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not necessary to mention the different species
into which this disease has been divided, as they
differ from one another chiefly in degree. What is
called the <i>land-scurvy</i>, however, is seldom attended
with those highly putrid symptoms which appear in
patients who have been long at sea, and which, we
presume, are rather owing to confined air, want of
exercise, and the unwholesome food eaten by sailors
on long voyages, than to any specific difference in
the disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The scurvy is occasioned by cold
moist air; by the long use of salted or smoke-dried
provisions, or any kind of food that is hard of digestion,
and affords little nourishment. It may
also proceed from the suppression of customary evacuations;
as the <i>menses</i>, the hæmorrhoidal flux, &#38;c.
It is sometimes owing to a hereditary taint, in
which case a very small cause will excite the latent
disorder. Grief, fear, and other depressing passions,
have a great tendency both to excite and aggravate
this disease. The same observation holds with regard
to neglect of cleanliness; bad clothing; the
want of proper exercise; confined air; unwholesome
<span class='pageno' id='Page_394'>394</span>food; or any disease which greatly weakens
the body, or vitiates the humours.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——This disease may be known
by unusual weariness, heaviness, and difficulty of
breathing, especially after motion; rottenness of
the gums, which are apt to bleed on the slightest
touch; a stinking breath; frequent bleeding at the
nose; crackling of the joints; difficulty of walking;
sometimes a swelling and sometimes a falling
away of the legs, on which there are livid, yellow,
or violet-coloured spots; the face is generally of a
pale or leaden colour. As the disease advances,
other symptoms come on; as rottenness of the
teeth, hæmorrhages, or discharges of blood from
different parts of the body, foul obstinate ulcers,
pains in various parts, especially about the breast,
dry scaly eruptions all over the body, &#38;c. At last
a wasting or hectic fever comes on, and the miserable
patient is often carried off by a dysentery, a
diarrhœa, a dropsy, the palsy, fainting fits, or a
mortification of some of the bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>CURE.——We know no way of curing this disease
but by pursuing a plan directly opposite to that
which brings it on. It proceeds from a vitiated
state of the humours, occasioned by errors in
diet, air, or exercise; and this cannot be removed
but by a proper attention to these important articles.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient has been obliged to breathe a cold,
damp, or confined air, he should be removed, as
soon as possible, to a dry, open, and moderately
warm one. If there is reason to believe that the
disease proceeds from a sedentary life, or depressing
passions, as grief, fear, &#38;c. the patient must take
daily as much exercise in the open air as he can
bear, and his mind should be diverted by cheerful
company and other amusements. Nothing has a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_395'>395</span>greater tendency either to prevent or remove this
disease, than constant cheerfulness and good humour.
But this, alas! is seldom the lot of persons
afflicted with the scurvy; they are generally surly,
peevish, and morose.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the scurvy has been brought on by a long
use of salted provisions, the proper medicine is a
diet consisting chiefly of fresh vegetables; as
oranges, apples, lemons, limes, tamarinds, water-cresses,
scurvy-grass, brook lime, &#38;c. The use
of these, with milk, pot-herbs, new bread, and
fresh beer or cyder, will seldom fail to remove a
scurvy of this kind, if taken before it be too far
advanced; but to have this effect, they must be
persisted in for a considerable time. When fresh
vegetables cannot be obtained, pickled or preserved
ones may be used; and where these are wanting,
recourse must be had to the chymical acids. All
the patient’s food and drink should in this case be
sharpened with cream of tartar, elixir of vitriol,
vinegar, or the spirit of sea-salt.</p>

<p class='c008'>These things however will more certainly prevent
than cure the scurvy; for which reason sea-faring
people, especially on long voyages, ought to
lay in plenty of them. Cabbages, onions, gooseberries,
and many other vegetables, may be kept
a long time by <i>pickling</i>, <i>preserving</i>, &#38;c. and when
these fail, the chymical acids, recommended above,
which will keep for any length of time, may be
used. We have reason to believe, if ships were
well ventilated, had good store of fruits, greens,
cyder, &#38;c. laid in, and if proper regard were paid
to cleanliness and warmth, that sailors would be
the most healthy people in the world, and would
seldom suffer either from the scurvy or putrid fevers,
which are so fatal to that useful set of men; but it
is too much the temper of such people to despise
all precaution; they will not think of any calamity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_396'>396</span>till it overtakes them, when it is too late to ward
off the blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must indeed be owned, that many of them have
it not in their power to make the provision we are
speaking of; but in this case it is the duty of their
employers to make it for them; and no man ought
to engage in a long voyage without having these articles
secured.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have often seen very extraordinary effects in
the land-scurvy from a milk diet. This preparation
of Nature is a mixture of animal and vegetable
properties, which of all others is the most fit
for restoring a decayed constitution, and removing
that particular acrimony of the humours, which
seems to constitute the very essence of the scurvy,
and many other diseases. But people despise this
wholesome and nourishing food, because it is cheap,
and devour with greediness, flesh, and fermented
liquors, while milk is only deemed fit for their
hogs.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper drink in the scurvy is whey or
butter-milk. When these cannot be had, sound
cyder, perry, or spruce-beer, may be used. Wort
has likewise been found to be a proper drink in the
scurvy, and may be used at sea, as malt will keep
during the longest voyage. A decoction of the
tops of the spruce fir is likewise proper. It may be
drank in the quantity of an English pint twice a-day.
Tar-water may be used for the same purpose,
or decoctions of any of the mild mucilaginous
vegetables; as sarsaparilla, marsh-mallow
roots, &#38;c. Infusions of the bitter plants, as ground-ivy,
the lesser centaury, marsh-trefoil, &#38;c. are
likewise beneficial. I have seen the peasants in
some parts of Britain express the juice of the last-mentioned
plant, and drink it with good effect in
those foul scorbutic eruptions with which they are
often troubled in the spring season.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_397'>397</span>Harrowgate water is certainly an excellent medicine
in the land-scurvy. I have often seen patients
who had been reduced to the most deplorable condition
by this disease, greatly relieved by drinking
the sulphur-water, and bathing in it. The chalybeate water
may also be used with advantage, especially
with a view to brace the stomach after drinking
the sulphur-water, which, though it sharpens
the appetite, never fails to weaken the powers of
digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>A slight degree of scurvy may be carried off by
frequently sucking a little of the juice of a bitter
orange, or a lemon. When the disease affects the
gums only, this practice, if continued for some
time, will generally carry it off. We would however
recommend the bitter orange as greatly preferable
to lemon; it seems to be as good a medicine,
and is not near so hurtful to the stomach.
Perhaps our own sorrel may be little inferior to either
of them.</p>

<p class='c008'>All kinds of sallad are good in the scurvy, and
ought to be eaten very plentifully, as spinage, lettuce,
parsley, celery, endive, radish, dandelion, &#38;c.
It is amazing to see how soon fresh vegetables in the
spring cure the brute animals of any scab or foulness
which is upon their skins. It is reasonable to
suppose that their effects would be as great upon
the human species, were they used in proper quantity
for a sufficient length of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have sometimes seen good effects in scorbutic
complaints of very long standing, from the use of
a decoction of the roots of water-dock. It is usually
made by boiling a pound of the fresh root in six
English pints of water, till about one-third of it be
consumed. The dose is from half a pint to a whole
pint of the decoction every day. But in all the
cases where I have seen it prove beneficial, it was
made much stronger, and drank in larger quantities.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_398'>398</span>The safest way, however, is for the patient to
begin with small doses, and increase them both in
strength and quantity as he finds his stomach will
bear it. It must be used for a considerable time.
I have known some take it for many months, and
have been told of others who had used it for several
years, before they were sensible of any benefit, but
who nevertheless were cured by it at length.</p>

<p class='c008'>The leprosy, which was so common in this country
long ago, seems to have been near-akin to the
scurvy. Perhaps its appearing so seldom now,
may be owing to the inhabitants of Britain eating
more vegetable food than formerly, living more
upon tea and other diluting diet, using less salted
meat, being more cleanly, better lodged and
clothed, &#38;c.—For the cure of this disease we would
recommend the same course of diet and medicine
as in the scurvy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE SCROPHULA, OR KING’S EVIL.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This disease chiefly affects the glands, especially
those of the neck. Children and young persons of
a sedentary life are very subject to it. It is one of
those diseases which may be removed by proper regimen,
but seldom yields to medicine. The inhabitants
of cold, damp, marshy countries are most
liable to the scrophula.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——This disease may proceed from
a hereditary taint, from a scrophulous nurse, &#38;c.
Children who have the misfortune to be born of
sickly parents, whose constitutions have been greatly
injured by the pox, or other chronic diseases, are
apt to be affected with the scrophula. It may likewise
proceed from such diseases as weaken the habit
or vitiate the humours, as the small-pox,
measles, &#38;c. External injuries, as blows, bruises,
and the like, sometimes produce scrophulous ulcers;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_399'>399</span>but we have reason to believe, when this
happens, that there has been a predisposition in
the habit to this disease. In short, whatever tends
to vitiate the humours or relax the solids, paves
the way to the scrophula; as the want of proper
exercise, too much heat or cold, confined air, unwholesome
food, bad water, the long use of poor,
weak, watery aliments, the neglect of cleanliness,
&#38;c. Nothing tends more to induce this disease in
children than allowing them to continue long
wet<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c010'><sup>[141]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——At first small knots appear
under the chin or behind the ears, which gradually
increase in number and size, till they form one large
hard tumour. This often continues for a long
time without breaking, and when it does break,
it only discharges a thin <i>sanies</i>, or watery humour.
Other parts of the body are likewise liable to its
attack, as the armpits, groins, feet, hands, eyes,
breasts, &#38;c. Nor are the internal parts exempt
from it. It often affects the lungs, liver, or spleen;
and I have frequently seen the glands of the mesentery
greatly enlarged by it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those obstinate ulcers which break out upon the
feet and hands with swelling, and little or no redness,
are of the scrophulous kind. They seldom
discharge good matter, and are exceedingly difficult
to cure. The <i>white swellings</i> of the joints seem
likewise to be of this kind. They are with difficulty
brought to a suppuration, and when opened
they only discharge a thin ichor. There is not a
more general symptom of the scrophula than a
swelling of the upper lip and nose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_400'>400</span>REGIMEN.——As this disease proceeds, in a
great measure, from relaxation, the diet ought to
be generous and nourishing, but at the same time
light and of easy digestion; as well-fermented
bread, made of sound grain, the flesh and broth of
young animals, with now and then a glass of generous
wine, or good ale. The air ought to be open,
dry, and not too cold, and the patient should take
as much exercise as he can bear. This is of the utmost
importance. Children who have sufficient
exercise are seldom troubled with the scrophula.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——The vulgar are remarkably
credulous with regard to the cure of the scrophula;
many of them believing in the virtue of the royal
touch, that of the seventh son, &#38;c. The truth is,
we know but little either of the nature or cure of
this disease, and where reason or medicines fail,
superstition always comes in their place. Hence
it is, that in diseases which are the most difficult to
understand, we generally hear of the greatest number
of miraculous cures being performed. Here,
however, the deception is easily accounted for. The
scrophula, at a certain period of life, often cures
of itself; and, if the patient happens to be touched
about this time, the cure is imputed to the touch,
and not to Nature, who is really the physician. In
the same way the insignificant nostrums of quacks
and old women often gain applause when they deserve
none.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is nothing more pernicious than the custom
of plying children in the scrophula with strong purgative
medicines. People imagine it proceeds from
humours which must be purged off, without considering
that these purgatives increase the debility
and aggravate the disease. It has indeed been
found, that keeping the body gently open for some
time, especially with sea-water, has a good effect;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_401'>401</span>but this should only be given in gross habits, and
in such quantity as to procure one, or at most two
stools every day.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bathing in the salt-water has likewise a very
good effect, especially in the warm season. I
have often known a course of bathing in salt-water,
and drinking it in such quantities as to keep the
body gently open, cure a scrophula, after many
other medicines had been tried in vain. When
salt-water cannot be obtained, the patient may be
bathed in fresh water, and his body kept open by
small quantities of salt and water, or some other
mild purgative.</p>

<p class='c008'>Next to cold bathing, and drinking the salt-water,
we would recommend the Peruvian bark.
The cold bath may be used in summer, and the
bark in winter. To an adult half a drachm of the
bark in powder may be given in a glass of red wine
four or five times a-day. Children, and such as
cannot take it in substance, may use the decoction
made in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>Boil an ounce of Peruvian bark and a drachm of
Winter’s bark, both grossly powdered, in an English
quart of water to a pint: towards the end half
an ounce of sliced liquorice-root, and a handful of
raisins may be added, which will both render the
decoction less disagreeable, and make it take up
more of the bark. The liquor must be strained,
and two, three, or four table-spoonfuls, according
to the age of the patient, given three times
a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Moffat and Harrowgate waters, especially
the latter, are likewise very proper medicines in
the scrophula. They ought not however to be drank
in large quantities, but should be taken so as to
keep the body gently open, and must be used for a
considerable time.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_402'>402</span>The hemlock may sometimes be used with advantage
in the scrophula. Some lay it down as a
general rule, that the sea-water is most proper before
there are any suppuration or symptoms of
<i>tabes</i>; the Peruvian bark, when there are running
sores, and a degree of hectic fever, and the hemlock
in old inveterate cases, approaching to the
scirrhous or cancerous state. Either the extract or
the fresh juice of this plant may be used. The
dose must be small at first, and increased gradually
as far as the stomach is able to bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>External applications are of little use. Before
the tumour breaks, nothing ought to be applied to
it, unless a piece of flannel, or something to keep
it warm. After it breaks, the sore may be dressed
with some digestive ointment. What I have always
found to answer best, was the yellow basilicon
mixed with about a sixth or eighth part of its
weight of red precipitate of mercury. The sore
may be dressed with this twice a-day; and if it be
very fungous, and does not digest well, a larger
proportion of the precipitate may be added.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicines which mitigate this disease, though
they do not cure it, are not to be despised. If the
patient can be kept alive by any means till he arrives
at the age of puberty, he has a great chance
to get well; but if he does not recover at this
time, in all probability he never will.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no malady which parents are so apt to
communicate to their offspring as the scrophula,
for which reason people ought to beware of marrying
into families affected with this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the means of preventing the scrophula, we
must refer the reader to the observations on nursing,
at the beginning of the book.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_403'>403</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF THE ITCH.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Though this disease is commonly communicated
by infection, yet it seldom prevails where due regard
is paid to cleanliness, fresh air, and wholesome
diet. It generally appears in form of small
watery pustules, first about the wrists, or between
the fingers; afterwards it affects the arms, legs,
thighs, &#38;c. These pustules are attended with an
intolerable itching, especially when the patient is
warm a-bed, or sits by the fire. Sometimes indeed
the skin is covered with large blotches or scabs,
and at other times with a white scurf, or scaly eruption.
This last is called the dry itch, and is the
most difficult to cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The itch is seldom a dangerous disease, unless
when it is rendered so by neglect, or improper
treatment. If it be suffered to continue too long,
it may vitiate the whole mass of humours; and, if
it be suddenly drove in, without proper evacuations,
it may occasion fevers, inflammations of the
viscera, or other internal disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best medicine yet known for the itch is
sulphur, which ought to be used both externally
and internally. The parts most affected may be
rubbed with an ointment made of the flower of
sulphur, two ounces; crude sal ammoniac finely
powdered two drachms; hog’s lard, or butter, four
ounces. If a scruple or half a drachm of the essence
of lemon be added, it will entirely take away
the disagreeable smell. About the bulk of a nutmeg
of this may be rubbed upon the extremities at
bed-time twice or thrice a-week. It is seldom necessary
to rub the whole body; but when it is, it
ought not to be done all at once, but by turns, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_404'>404</span>it is dangerous to stop too many pores at the same
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Before the patient begins to use the ointment, he
ought, if he be of a full habit, to bleed or take a
purge or two. It will likewise be proper, during
the use of it, to take every night and morning as
much of the flower of brimstone and cream of tartar,
in a little treacle or new milk, as will keep
the body gently open. He should beware of catching
cold, should wear more clothes than usual, and
take every thing warm. The same clothes, the
linen excepted, ought to be worn all the time of
using the ointment; and such clothes as have
been worn while the patient was under the disease,
are not to be used again, unless they have
been fumigated with brimstone, and thoroughly
cleaned, otherwise they will communicate the infection
anew<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c010'><sup>[142]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>I never knew brimstone, when used as directed
above, fail to cure the itch; and I have reason to
believe, that, if duly persisted in, it never will
fail; but if it be only used once or twice, and cleanliness
neglected, it is no wonder if the disorder returns.
The quantity of ointment mentioned above
will generally be sufficient for the cure of one person;
but, if any symptoms of the disease should appear
again, the medicine may be repeated. It is
both more safe and efficacious when persisted in for
a considerable time, than when a large quantity is
applied at once. As most people dislike the smell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_405'>405</span>of sulphur, they may use in its place the powder of
white hellebore root made up into an ointment, in
the same manner, which will seldom fail to cure
the itch.</p>

<p class='c008'>People ought to be extremely cautious lest they
take other eruptions for the itch; as the stoppage of
these may be attended with fatal consequences.
Many of the eruptive disorders to which children
are liable, have a near resemblance to this disease;
and I have often known infants killed by being rubbed
with greasy ointments that made these eruptions
strike suddenly in, which Nature had thrown
out to preserve the patient’s life, or prevent some
other malady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Much mischief is likewise done by the use of
mercury in this disease. Some persons are so fool-hardy
as to wash the parts affected with a strong solution
of the corrosive sublimate. Others use the
mercurial ointment, without taking the least care
either to avoid cold, keep the body open, or observe
a proper regimen. The consequences of such
conduct may be easily guessed. I have known
even the mercurial girdles produce bad effects, and
would advise every person, as he values his health,
to beware how he uses them. Mercury ought never
to be used as a medicine without the greatest
care. Ignorant people look upon these girdles as a
kind of charm, without considering that the mercury
enters the body.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not to be told what mischief is done by using
mercurial ointment for curing the itch and killing
vermin; yet it is unnecessary for either: the former
may be always more certainly cured by sulphur,
and the latter will never be found where due regard
is paid to cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who would avoid this detestable disease
ought to beware of infected persons, to use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_406'>406</span>wholesome food, and to study universal cleanliness<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c010'><sup>[143]</sup></a>.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XL.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE ASTHMA.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The asthma is a disease of the lungs, which
seldom admits of a cure. Persons in the decline
of life are most liable to it. It is distinguished
into the moist and dry, or humoural and nervous.
The former is attended with expectoration or spitting;
but in the latter the patient seldom spits,
unless sometimes a little tough phlegm by the mere
force of coughing.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The asthma is sometimes hereditary.
It may likewise proceed from a bad formation
of the breast; the fumes of metals or minerals
taken into the lungs; violent exercise, especially
running; the obstruction of customary evacuations,
as the menses, hæmorrhoids, &#38;c. the sudden retrocession
of the gout, or striking in of eruptions,
as the small-pox, measles, &#38;c. violent passions of
the mind, as sudden fear or surprise. In a word,
the disease may proceed from any cause that either
impedes the circulation of the blood through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_407'>407</span>lungs, or prevents their being duly expanded by
the air.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——An asthma is known by a
quick laborious breathing, which is generally performed
with a kind of wheezing noise. Sometimes
the difficulty of breathing is so great, that the patient
is obliged to keep in an erect posture, otherwise
he is in danger of being suffocated. A fit or
paroxysm of the asthma generally happens after a
person has been exposed to cold easterly winds, or
has been abroad in thick foggy weather, or has got
wet, or continued long in a damp place under
ground, or has taken some food which the stomach
could not digest, as pastries, toasted cheese, or the
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>The paroxysm is commonly ushered in with listlessness,
want of sleep, hoarseness, a cough, belching
of wind, a sense of heaviness about the breast,
and difficulty of breathing. To these succeed heat,
fever, pain of the head, sickness and nausea, great
oppression of the breast, palpitation of the heart, a
weak and sometimes intermitting pulse, an involuntary
flow of tears, bilious vomitings, &#38;c. All
the symptoms grow worse towards night; the patient
is easier when up than in bed, and is very desirous
of cool air.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The food ought to be light, and
of easy digestion. Boiled meats are to be preferred
to roasted, and the flesh of young animals to that of
old. All windy food, and whatever is apt to swell
in the stomach, is to be avoided. Light puddings,
white broths, and ripe fruits baked, boiled, or
roasted, are proper. Strong liquors of all kinds,
especially malt-liquor, are hurtful. The patient
should eat a very light supper, or rather none at
all, and should never suffer himself to be long
costive. His clothing should be warm, especially
in the winter-season. As all disorders of the breast
<span class='pageno' id='Page_408'>408</span>are much relieved by keeping the feet warm, and promoting
the perspiration, a flannel shirt or waistcoat,
and thick shoes, will be of singular service.</p>

<p class='c008'>But nothing is of so great importance in the
asthma as pure and moderately warm air. Asthmatic
people can seldom bear either the close heavy
air of a large town, or the sharp, keen atmosphere
of a bleak hilly country; a medium therefore between
these is to be chosen. The air near a large
town is often better than at a distance, provided
the patient be removed so far as not to be affected
by the smoke. Some asthmatic patients indeed
breathe easier in town than in the country; but this
is seldom the case, especially in towns where much
coal is burnt. Asthmatic persons who are obliged
to be in town all day, ought at least to sleep out of
it. Even this will often prove of great service.
Those who can afford it ought to travel into a
warmer climate. Many asthmatic persons who cannot
live in Britain, enjoy very good health in the
south of France, Portugal, Spain, or Italy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise is likewise of very great importance in
the asthma, as it promotes the digestion, preparation
of the blood, &#38;c. The blood of asthmatic
persons is seldom duly prepared, owing to the proper
action of the lungs being impeded. For this
reason such people ought daily to take as much exercise,
either on foot, horseback, or in a carriage, as
they can bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Almost all that can be done
by medicine in this disease, is to relieve the patient
when seized with a violent fit. This indeed requires
the greatest expedition, as the disease often
proves suddenly fatal. In the paroxysm or fit, the
body is generally bound; a purging clyster, with
a solution of asafœtida, ought therefore to be administered,
and if there be occasion, it may be repeated
two or three times. The patient’s feet and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_409'>409</span>legs ought to be immersed in warm water, and afterwards
rubbed with a warm hand, or dry cloth.
Bleeding, unless extreme weakness or old age
should forbid it, is highly proper. If there be a
violent spasm about the breast or stomach, warm
fomentations, or bladders filled with warm milk and
water, may be applied to the part affected, and
warm cataplasms to the soles of the feet. The patient
must drink freely of diluting liquors, and may
take a tea-spoonful of the tincture of castor and of
saffron mixed together, in a cup of valerian-tea,
twice or thrice a-day. Sometimes a vomit has a
very good effect, and snatches the patient, as it
were, from the jaws of death. This however will
be more safe after other evacuations have been premised.
A very strong infusion of roasted coffee
is said to give ease in an asthmatic paroxysm.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the moist asthma, such things as promote expectoration
or spitting ought to be used; as the syrup
of squills, gum ammoniac, and such like. A
common spoonful of the syrup, or oxymel of squills,
mixed with an equal quantity of cinnamon-water,
may be taken three or four times through the day,
and four or five pills made of equal parts of asafœtida
and gum-ammoniac, at bed-time<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c010'><sup>[144]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the convulsive or nervous asthma, antispasmodics
and bracers are the most proper medicines.
The patient may take a tea-spoonful of the paregoric
elixir twice a-day. The Peruvian bark is sometimes
found to be of use in this case. It may be
taken in substance, or infused in wine. In short,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_410'>410</span>every thing that braces the nerves, or takes off
spasm, may be of use in a nervous asthma. It is
often relieved by the use of asses milk; I have likewise
known cows milk drank warm in the morning
have a very good effect in this case.</p>

<p class='c008'>In every species of asthma, setons and issues have
a good effect; they may either be set in the back or
side, and should never be allowed to dry up. We
shall here, once for all, observe, that not only in
the asthma, but in most chronic diseases, issues are
extremely proper. They are both a safe and efficacious
remedy; and though they do not always
cure the disease, yet they will often prolong the patient’s
life.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE APOPLEXY.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The apoplexy is a sudden loss of sense and motion,
wherein the patient is to all appearance
dead; the heart and lungs however still continue to
move. Though this disease proves often fatal, yet
it may sometimes be removed by proper care. It
chiefly attacks sedentary persons of a gross habit,
who use a rich and plentiful diet, and indulge in
strong liquors. People in the decline of life are
most subject to the apoplexy. It prevails most in
winter, especially in rainy seasons, and very low
states of the barometer.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The immediate cause of an apoplexy
is a compression of the brain, occasioned by
an excess of blood, or a collection of watery humours.
The former is called a <i>sanguine</i>, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_411'>411</span>latter a <i>serous apoplexy</i>. It may be occasioned by
any thing that increases the circulation towards the
brain, or prevents the return of the blood from the
head; as intense study; violent passions<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c010'><sup>[145]</sup></a>; viewing
objects for a long time obliquely; wearing any
thing too tight about the neck; a rich and luxurious
diet; suppression of urine; suffering the body
to cool suddenly after having been greatly heated;
continuing long in a warm or a cold bath; the excessive
use of spiceries, or high-seasoned food; excess
of venery; the sudden striking in of any eruption;
suffering issues, setons, &#38;c. suddenly to dry
up, or the stoppage of any customary evacuation;
a mercurial salivation pushed too far, or suddenly
checked by cold; wounds or bruises on the head;
long exposure to excessive cold; poisonous exhalations,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS, and method of cure.——The
usual forerunners of an apoplexy are giddiness, pain
and swimming of the head; loss of memory; drowsiness;
noise in the ears; the night-mare; a spontaneous
flux of tears, and laborious respiration.
When persons of an apoplectic make observe these
symptoms, they have reason to fear the approach of
a fit, and should endeavour to prevent it by bleeding,
a slender diet, and opening medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the sanguine apoplexy, if the patient does not
die suddenly, the countenance appears florid, the
face is swelled or puffed up, and the blood-vessels,
especially about the neck and temples, are turgid;
the pulse beats strong; the eyes are prominent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_412'>412</span>fixed, and the breathing is difficult, and performed
with a snorting noise. The excrements and urine
are often voided spontaneously, and the patient is
sometimes seized with vomiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>In this species of apoplexy every method must be
taken to lessen the force of the circulation towards
the head. The patient should be kept perfectly
easy and cool. His head should be raised pretty
high, and his feet suffered to hang down. His
clothes ought to be loosened, especially about the
neck, and fresh air admitted into his chamber.
His garters should be tied pretty tight, by which
means the motion of the blood from the lower extremities
will be retarded. As soon as the patient
is placed in a proper posture, he should be bled
freely in the neck or arm, and, if there be occasion,
the operation may be repeated in two or three hours.
A laxative clyster, with plenty of sweet oil, or fresh
butter, and a spoonful or two of common salt in
it, may be administered every two hours; and blistering-plasters
applied between the shoulders, and
to the calves of the legs.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the symptoms are a little abated, and
the patient is able to swallow, he ought to drink
freely of some diluting opening liquor, as a decoction
of tamarinds and liquorice, cream-tartar-whey,
or common whey with cream of tartar dissolved in
it. Or he may take any cooling purge, as Glauber’s
salt, manna dissolved in an infusion of senna,
or the like. All spirits and other strong liquors are
to be avoided. Even volatile salts held to the
nose do mischief. Vomits, for the same reason,
ought not to be given, nor any thing that may increase
the motion of the blood towards the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the serous apoplexy, the symptoms are nearly
the same, only the pulse is not so strong, the countenance
is less florid, and the breathing less difficult.
Bleeding is not so necessary here as in the former
<span class='pageno' id='Page_413'>413</span>case. It may however generally be performed once
with safety and advantage, but should not be repeated.
The patient should be placed in the same
posture as directed above, and should have blistering-plasters
applied, and receive opening clysters in
the same manner. Purges here are likewise necessary,
and the patient may drink strong balm-tea.
If he be inclined to sweat, it ought to be promoted
by drinking small wine-whey, or an infusion of carduus
benedictus. A plentiful sweat kept up for a
considerable time has often carried off a serous
apoplexy.</p>

<p class='c008'>When apoplectic symptoms proceed from opium,
or other narcotic substances taken into the stomach,
vomits are necessary. The patient is generally relieved
as soon as he has discharged the poison in
this way.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons of an apoplectic make, or those who
have been attacked by it, ought to use a very spare
and slender diet, avoiding all strong liquors, spiceries,
and high-seasoned food. They ought likewise
to guard against all violent passions, and to avoid
the extremes of heat and cold. The head should
be shaved, and daily washed with cold water. The
feet ought to be kept warm, and never suffered to
continue long wet. The body must be kept open
either by food or medicine, and a little blood may
be let every spring and fall. Exercise should by no
means be neglected; but it ought to be taken in
moderation. Nothing has a more happy effect in
preventing an apoplexy than perpetual issues or setons;
great care however must be taken not to suffer
them to dry up, without opening others in their
stead. Apoplectic persons ought never to go to rest
with a full stomach, or to lie with their heads low,
or wear any thing too tight about their necks.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_414'>414</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF COSTIVENESS, AND OTHER AFFECTIONS OF THE STOMACH AND BOWELS.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>We do not here mean to treat of those astrictions
of the bowels which are the symptoms
of diseases, as of the colic, the iliac passion, &#38;c.
but only to take notice of that infrequency of stools
which sometimes happens, and which in some
particular constitutions may occasion diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Costiveness may proceed from drinking rough
red wines, or other astringent liquors; too much
exercise, especially on horseback. It may likewise
proceed from a long use of cold insipid
food, which does not sufficiently stimulate the
intestines. Sometimes it is owing to the bile not
descending to the intestines, as in the jaundice; and
at other times it proceeds from diseases of the intestines
themselves, as a palsy, spasms, torpor, tumours,
a cold dry state of the intestines, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Excessive costiveness is apt to occasion pains of
the head, vomiting, colics, and other complaints
of the bowels. It is peculiarly hurtful to hypochondriac
and hysteric persons, as it generates wind
and other grievous symptoms. Some people however
can bear costiveness to a great degree. I know
persons who enjoy pretty good health, yet do not
go to stool above once a-week, and others not above
once a fortnight. Indeed I have heard of some who
do not go above once a month.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who are generally costive should live upon
a moistening and laxative diet, as roasted or boiled
apples, pears, stewed prunes, raisins, gruels with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_415'>415</span>currants, butter, honey, sugar, and such like.
Broths with spinage, leeks, and other soft pot-herbs,
are likewise proper. Rye-bread, or that
which is made of a mixture of wheat and rye together,
ought to be eaten. No person troubled with
costiveness should eat white bread alone, especially
that which is made of fine flour. The best bread
for keeping the body soluble is what in some parts
of England they call <i>meslin</i>. It is made of a mixture
of wheat and rye, and is very agreeable to
those who are accustomed to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Costiveness is increased by keeping the body too
warm, and by every thing that promotes the perspiration;
as wearing flannel, lying <a id='t415'></a>too long a-bed,
&#38;c. Intense thought, and a sedentary life, are likewise
hurtful. All the secretions and excretions are
promoted by moderate exercise without doors, and
by a gay, cheerful, sprightly temper of mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>The drink should be of an opening quality. All
ardent spirits, austere and astringent wines, as port,
claret, &#38;c. ought to be avoided. Malt-liquor
that is fine, and of a moderate strength, is very proper.
Butter-milk, whey, and other watery liquors,
are likewise proper, and may be drank in turns, as
the patient’s inclination directs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who are troubled with costiveness, ought,
if possible, to remedy it by diet, as the constant
use of medicines for that purpose is attended with
many inconveniencies, and often with bad consequences<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c010'><sup>[146]</sup></a>.
I never knew any one get into a habit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_416'>416</span>of taking medicine for keeping the body open,
who could leave it off. In time the custom becomes
necessary, and generally ends in a total relaxation
of the bowels, indigestion, loss of appetite,
wasting of the strength, and death.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the body cannot be kept open without
medicine, we would recommend gentle doses of
rhubarb to be taken twice or thrice a-week. This
is not near so injurious to the stomach as aloes, jalap,
or the other drastic purgatives so much in use.
Infusions of senna and manna may likewise be
taken, or half an ounce of soluble tartar dissolved
in water-gruel. About the size of a nutmeg of
lenitive electuary taken twice or thrice a-day generally
answers the purpose very well.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WANT OF APPETITE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This may proceed from a foul stomach; indigestion;
the want of free air and exercise; grief;
fear; anxiety; or any of the depressing passions;
excessive heat; the use of strong broths, fat meats,
or any thing that palls the appetite, or is hard of
digestion, the immoderate use of strong liquors,
tea, tobacco, opium, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_417'>417</span>The patient ought, if possible, to make choice
of an open dry air; to take exercise daily on horseback
or in a carriage; to rise betimes; and to
avoid all intense thought. He should use a diet of
easy digestion; and should avoid excessive heat
and great fatigue.</p>

<p class='c008'>If want of appetite proceeds from errors in diet,
or any other part of the patient’s regimen, it ought
to be changed. If nausea and reachings shew that
the stomach is loaded with crudities, a vomit will
be of service. After this a gentle purge or two of
rhubarb, or of any of the bitter purging salts, may
be taken. The patient ought next to use some of
the stomachic bitters infused in wine. Though
gentle evacuations be necessary, yet strong purges
and vomits are to be avoided, as they weaken the
stomach, and hurt digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Elixir of vitriol is an excellent medicine in
most cases of indigestion, weakness of the stomach,
or want of appetite. From twenty to thirty
drops of it may be taken twice or thrice a-day in
a glass of wine or water. It may likewise be mixed
with the tincture of the bark, one drachm of the
former to an ounce of the latter, and two tea-spoonfuls
of it taken in wine or water, as above.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chalybeate waters, if drank in moderation,
are generally of considerable service in this case.
The salt-water has likewise good effects; but it
must not be used too freely. The waters of Harrowgate,
Scarborough, Moffat, and most other Spas
in Britain, may be used with advantage. We would
advise all who are afflicted with indigestion and
want of appetite, to repair to these places of public
rendezvous. The very change of air, and the
cheerful company, will be of service; not to mention
the exercise, dissipation, amusements, &#38;c.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_418'>418</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF THE HEART-BURN.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>What is commonly called the <i>heart-burn</i>, is not
a disease of that organ, but an uneasy sensation of
heat or acrimony about the pit of the stomach,
which is sometimes attended with anxiety, nausea,
and vomiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may proceed from debility of the stomach, indigestion,
bile, the abounding of an acid in the stomach,
&#38;c. Persons who are liable to this complaint
ought to avoid stale liquors, acids, windy
or greasy aliments, and should never use violent
exercise soon after a plentiful meal. I know many
persons who never fail to have the heart-burn if
they ride soon after dinner, provided they have drank
ale, wine, or any fermented liquor; but are never
troubled with it when they have drank rum or
brandy and water without any sugar or acid.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the heart-burn proceeds from debility
of the stomach, or indigestion, the patient ought to
take a dose or two of rhubarb; afterwards he may
use infusions of the Peruvian bark, or any other of
the stomachic bitters, in wine or brandy. Exercise
in the open air will likewise be of use, and
every thing that promotes digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>When bilious humours occasion the heart-burn,
a tea-spoonful of the sweet spirit of nitre in a glass
of water, or a cup of tea, will generally give ease.
If it proceeds from the use of greasy aliments, a
dram of brandy or rum may be taken.</p>

<p class='c008'>If acidity or sourness of the stomach occasions
the heart-burn, absorbents are the proper medicines.
In this case an ounce of powdered chalk,
half an ounce of fine sugar, and a quarter of an
ounce of gum-arabic, may be mixed in an English
quart of water, and a tea-cupful of it taken as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_419'>419</span>often as is necessary. Such as do not chuse chalk
may take a tea-spoonful of prepared oyster-shells,
or of the powder called crabs eyes, in a glass of
cinnamon or peppermint-water. But the safest and
bed absorbent is <i>magnesia alba</i>. This not only acts
as an absorbent, but likewise as a purgative; whereas
chalk, and other absorbents of that kind, are
apt to lie in the intestines, and occasion obstructions.
This powder is not disagreeable, and may
be taken in a cup of tea, or a glass of mint-water.
A large tea-spoonful is the usual dose; but it may
be taken in a much greater quantity when there is
occasion. These things are now generally made
up into lozenges for the conveniency of being carried
in the pocket, and taken at pleasure.</p>

<p class='c008'>If wind be the cause of this complaint, the
most proper medicines are those called carminatives;
as anniseeds, juniper-berries, ginger, canella
alba, cardamom seeds, &#38;c. These may either
be chewed, or infused in wine, brandy, or
other spirits. One of the safest medicines of this
kind is the tincture made by infusing an ounce of
rhubarb, and a quarter of an ounce of the lesser
cardamom seeds, in an English pint of brandy.
After this has digested for two or three days,
it ought to be strained, and four ounces of white
sugar-candy added to it. It must stand to digest
a second time till the sugar be dissolved. A
table-spoonful of it may be taken occasionally
for a dose.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have frequently known the heart-burn cured,
particularly in pregnant women, by chewing green
tea. Two table-spoonfuls of what is called the
milk of gum-ammoniac, taken once or twice a-day,
will sometimes cure the heart-burn.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_420'>420</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF NERVOUS DISEASES.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Of all diseases incident to mankind, those of
the nervous kind are the most complicated and
difficult to cure. A volume would not be sufficient
to point out their various appearances. They imitate
almost every disease; and are seldom alike in
two different persons, or even in the same person at
different times. Proteus-like, they are continually
changing shape; and upon every fresh attack, the
patient thinks he feels symptoms which he never
experienced before. Nor do they only affect the
body; the mind likewise suffers, and is often thereby
rendered extremely weak and peevish. The
low spirits, timorousness, melancholy, and fickleness
of temper, which generally attend nervous
disorders, induce many to believe that they are
entirely diseases of the mind; but this change of
temper is rather a consequence, than the cause of
nervous diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——Every thing that tends to relax or
weaken the body, disposes it to nervous diseases, as
indolence, excessive venery, drinking too much
tea, or other weak, watery liquors warm, frequent
bleeding, purging, vomiting, &#38;c. Whatever hurts
the digestion, or prevents the proper assimilation
of the food, has likewise this effect; as long fasting,
excess in eating or drinking, the use of windy,
crude, or unwholesome aliments, an unfavourable
posture of the body, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nervous disorders often proceed from intense application
to study. Indeed few studious persons
are entirely free from them. Nor is this at all to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_421'>421</span>be wondered at; intense thinking not only preys
upon the spirits, but prevents the person from
taking proper exercise, by which means the digestion
is impaired, the nourishment prevented,
the solids relaxed, and the whole mass of humours
vitiated. Grief and disappointment likewise produce
the same effects. I have known more nervous
patients, who dated the commencement of
their disorders from the loss of a husband, a favourite
child, or from some disappointment in life,
than from any other cause. In a word, whatever
weakens the body, or depresses the spirits, may occasion
nervous disorders, as unwholesome air, want
of sleep, great fatigue, disagreeable apprehensions,
anxiety, vexation, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——We shall only mention some
of the most general symptoms of these disorders, as
it would be both an useless and an endless task to
enumerate the whole. They generally begin with
windy inflations or distentions of the stomach and
intestines; the appetite and digestion are usually
bad; yet sometimes there is an uncommon craving
for food, and a quick digestion. The food often
turns sour on the stomach; and the patient is
troubled with vomiting of clear water, tough
phlegm, or a blackish-coloured liquor resembling
the grounds of coffee. Excruciating pains are
often felt about the navel, attended with a rumbling
or murmuring noise in the bowels. The
body is sometimes loose, but more commonly
bound, which occasions a retention of wind and
great uneasiness.</p>

<p class='c008'>The urine is sometimes in small quantity, at
other times very copious and quite clear. There
is a great straitness of the breast, with difficulty of
breathing; violent palpitations of the heart; sudden
flushings of heat in various parts of the body;
at other times a sense of cold, as if water were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_422'>422</span>poured on them; flying pains in the arms and
limbs; pains in the back and belly, resembling
those occasioned by gravel; the pulse very variable,
sometimes uncommonly slow, and at other times
very quick; yawning, the hiccup, frequent sighing,
and a sense of suffocation, as if from a ball
or lump in the throat; alternate fits of crying and
convulsive laughing; the sleep is unsound and seldom
refreshing; and the patient is often troubled
with the night-mare.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the disease increases, the patient is molested
with head-achs, cramps, and fixed pains in various
parts of the body; the eyes are clouded, and often
affected with pain and dryness; there is a noise in
the ears, and often a dulness of hearing; in short,
the whole animal functions are impaired. The mind
is disturbed on the most trivial occasions, and is
hurried into the most perverse commotions, inquietudes,
terror, sadness, anger, diffidence, &#38;c. The
patient is apt to entertain wild imaginations and
extravagant fancies; the memory becomes weak,
and the judgment fails.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing is more characteristic of this disease than
a constant dread of death. This renders those unhappy
persons who labour under it peevish, fickle,
impatient, and apt to run from one physician to
another; which is one reason why they seldom reap
any benefit from medicine, as they have not sufficient
resolution to persist in any one course till it
has time to produce its proper effects. They are
likewise apt to imagine that they labour under diseases
from which they are quite free; and are very
angry if any one attempts to set them right, or
laugh them out of their ridiculous notions.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Persons afflicted with nervous
diseases ought never to fast long. Their food
should be solid and nourishing, but of easy digestion.
Fat meats and heavy sauces are hurtful.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_423'>423</span>All excess should be carefully avoided. They ought
never to eat more at a time than they can easily
digest; but if they feel themselves weak and faint
between meals, they ought to eat a bit of bread,
and drink a glass of wine. Heavy suppers are to
be avoided. Though wine in excess enfeebles the
body, and impairs the faculties of the mind, yet
taken in moderation, it strengthens the stomach,
and promotes digestion. Wine and water is a very
proper drink at meals; but if wine sours on the
stomach, or the patient is much troubled with wind,
brandy and water will answer better. Every thing
that is windy or hard of digestion must be avoided.
All weak and warm liquors are hurtful, as tea,
coffee, punch, &#38;c. People may find a temporary
relief in the use of these, but they always increase
the malady, as they weaken the stomach and hurt
digestion. Above all things, drams are to be
avoided. Whatever immediate ease the patient
may feel from the use of ardent spirits, they are
sure to aggravate the malady, and prove certain
poisons at last. These cautions are the more necessary,
as most nervous people are peculiarly fond
of tea and ardent spirits; to the use of which many
of them fall victims.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise in nervous disorders is superior to all
medicines. Riding on horseback is generally esteemed
the best, as it gives motion to the whole body,
without fatiguing it. I have known some patients,
however, with whom walking agreed better, and
others who were most benefited by riding in a carriage.
Every one ought to use that which he finds
most beneficial. Long sea-voyages have an excellent
effect; and to those who have sufficient resolution,
we would by all means recommend this
course. Even change of place, and the sight of
new objects, by diverting the mind, have a great
tendency to remove these complaints. For this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_424'>424</span>reason a long journey, or a voyage, is of much
more advantage than riding short journeys near
home.</p>

<p class='c008'>A cool and dry air is proper, as it braces, and
invigorates the whole body. Few things tend
more to relax and enervate than hot air, especially
that which is rendered so by great fires, or
stoves in small apartments. But when the stomach
or bowels are weak, the body ought to be well
guarded against cold, especially in winter, by wearing
a thin flannel waistcoat next the skin. This
will keep up an equal perspiration, and defend the
alimentary canal from many impressions to which
it would otherwise be subject, upon every sudden
change from warm to cold weather. Rubbing the
body frequently with a flesh-brush, or a coarse linen
cloth, is likewise beneficial, as it promotes the circulation,
perspiration, &#38;c. Persons who have
weak nerves ought to rise early, and take exercise
before breakfast, as lying too long a-bed cannot
fail to relax the solids. They ought likewise to be
diverted, and to be kept as easy and cheerful as
possible. There is not any thing which hurts the
nervous system, or weakens the digestive powers,
more than fear, grief, or anxiety.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINES.——Though nervous diseases are
seldom radically cured, yet their symptoms may
sometimes be alleviated, and the patient’s life rendered
at least more comfortable by proper medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient is costive, he ought to take
a little rhubarb, or some other mild purgative, and
should never suffer his body to be long bound. All
strong and violent purgatives are however to be
avoided, as aloes, jalap, &#38;c. I have generally
seen an infusion of senna and rhubarb in brandy
answer very well. This may be made of any
strength, and taken in such quantity as the patient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_425'>425</span>finds necessary. When digestion is bad, or the stomach
relaxed and weak, the following infusion of
Peruvian bark and other bitters may be used with
advantage:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of Peruvian bark an ounce, gentian root,
orange-peel, and coriander-seed, of each half an
ounce; let these ingredients be all bruised in a
mortar, and infused in a bottle of brandy or whiskey,
for the space of five or six days. A table-spoonful
of the strained liquor may be taken in
half a glass of water, an hour before breakfast,
dinner, and supper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things tend more to strengthen the nervous
system than cold bathing. This practice, if duly
persisted in, will produce very extraordinary effects;
but when the liver or other <i>viscera</i> are obstructed,
or otherwise unsound, the cold bath is improper.
It is therefore to be used with very great caution.
The most proper seasons for it are summer and autumn.
It will be sufficient, especially for persons
of a spare habit, to go into the cold bath three
or four times a-week. If the patient be weakened
by it, or feels chilly for a long time after coming
out, it is improper.</p>

<p class='c008'>In patients afflicted with wind, I have always
observed the greatest benefit from the elixir of vitriol.
It may be taken in the quantity of fifteen,
twenty, or thirty drops, twice or thrice a-day in a
glass of water. This both expels wind, strengthens
the stomach, and promotes digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Opiates are generally extolled in these maladies;
but as they only palliate the symptoms, and generally
afterwards increase the disease, we would advise
people to be extremely sparing in the use of
them, lest habit render them at last absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>It would be an easy matter to enumerate many
medicines which have been extolled for relieving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_426'>426</span>nervous disorders; but whoever wishes for a thorough
cure must expect it from regimen alone; we
shall therefore omit mentioning more medicines,
and again recommend the strictest attention to <span class='fss'>DIET</span>,
<span class='fss'>AIR</span>, <span class='fss'>EXERCISE</span>, and <span class='fss'>AMUSEMENTS</span>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF MELANCHOLY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Melancholy is that state of alienation or weakness
of mind which renders people incapable of
enjoying the pleasures, or performing the duties of
life. It is a degree of insanity, and often terminates
in absolute madness.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——It may proceed from an hereditary
disposition; intense thinking, especially where the
mind is long occupied about one object; violent
passions or affections of the mind, as love, fear,
joy, grief, over-weening pride, and such like. It
may also be occasioned by excessive venery; narcotic
or stupefactive poisons; a sedentary life; solitude;
the suppression of customary evacuations;
acute fevers, or other diseases. Violent anger will
change melancholy into madness; and excessive
cold, especially of the lower extremities, will force
the blood into the brain, and produce all the symptoms
of madness. It may likewise proceed from
the use of aliment that is hard of digestion, or
which cannot be easily assimilated; from a callous
state of the integuments of the brain, or a dryness
of the brain itself. To all which we may add
gloomy or mistaken notions of religion.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——When persons begin to be
melancholy, they are timorous; watchful; fond of
solitude; fretful; fickle; captious and inquisitive;
solicitous about trifles; sometimes niggardly, and
at other times prodigal. The body is generally
bound; the urine thin, and in small quantity; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_427'>427</span>stomach and bowels inflated with wind; the complexion
pale; the pulse slow and weak. The functions
of the mind are also greatly perverted, in so
much that the patient often imagines himself dead,
or changed into some other animal. Some have
imagined their bodies were made of glass, or other
brittle substances, and were afraid to move, lest
they should be broken to pieces. The unhappy patient,
in this case, unless carefully watched, is apt
to put an end to his own miserable life.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is owing to an obstruction of
customary evacuations, or any bodily disorder, it
is easier cured than when it proceeds from affections
of the mind, or an hereditary taint. A discharge
of blood from the nose, looseness, scabby eruptions,
the bleeding piles, or the <i>menses</i>, sometimes
carry off this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The diet should consist chiefly
of vegetables of a cooling and opening quality.
Animal food, especially salted or smoke-dried fish
or flesh, ought to be avoided. All kinds of shell-fish
are bad. Aliments prepared with onions, garlic,
or any thing that generates thick blood, are
likewise improper. All kind of fruits that are
wholesome may be eaten with advantage. Boerhaave
gives an instance of a patient who, by a long use
of whey, water, and garden-fruit, recovered, after
having evacuated a great quantity of black-coloured
matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strong liquors of every kind ought to be avoided
as poison. The most proper drink is water,
whey, or very small beer. Tea and coffee are improper.
If honey agrees with the patient, it may
be eaten freely, or his drink may be sweetened with
it. Infusions of balm-leaves, penny-royal, the
roots of wild valerian, or the flowers of the lime-tree,
may be drank freely, either by themselves, or
sweetened with honey, as the patient shall chuse.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_428'>428</span>The patient ought to take as much exercise in the
open air as he can bear. This helps to dissolve the
viscid humours, it removes obstructions, promotes
the perspiration, and all the other secretions. Every
kind of madness is attended with a diminished perspiration;
all means ought therefore to be used to
promote that necessary and salutary discharge. Nothing
can have a more direct tendency to increase
the disease than confining the patient to a close
apartment. Were he forced to ride or walk a certain
number of miles every day, it would tend
greatly to alleviate his disorder; but it would have
still a better effect, if he were obliged to labour a
piece of ground. By digging, hoeing, planting,
sowing, &#38;c. both the body and mind would be
exercised. A long journey, or a voyage, especially
towards a warmer climate, with agreeable companions,
has often very happy effects. A plan of this
kind, with a strict attention to diet, is a much more
rational method of cure, than confining the patient
within doors and plying him with medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——In the cure of this disease
particular attention must be paid to the mind.
When the patient is in a low state, his mind ought
to be soothed and diverted with variety of amusements,
as entertaining stories, pastimes, music,
&#38;c. This seems to have been the method of
curing melancholy among the Jews, as we learn
from the story of King Saul; and indeed it is a very
rational one. Nothing can remove diseases of the
mind so effectually as applications to the mind itself,
the most efficacious of which is music. The
patient’s company ought likewise to consist of such
persons as are agreeable to him. People in this
state are apt to conceive unaccountable aversions
against particular persons; and the very sight of
such persons is sufficient to distract their minds, and
throw them into the utmost perturbation.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_429'>429</span>When the patient is high, evacuations are necessary.
In this case he must be bled, and have his
body kept open by purging medicines, as manna,
rhubarb, cream of tartar, or the soluble tartar. I
have seen the last have very happy effects. It may
be taken in the dose of half an ounce, dissolved in
water-gruel, every day, for sundry weeks, or even
for months, if necessary. More or less may be
given according as it operates. Vomits have likewise
a good effect; but they must be pretty strong,
otherwise they will not operate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whatever increases the evacuation of urine or
promotes perspiration, has a tendency to remove
this disease. Both these secretions may be promoted
by the use of nitre and vinegar. Half a
drachm of purified nitre may be given three or four
times a-day in any manner that is most agreeable to
the patient; and an ounce and a half of distilled
vinegar may be daily mixed with his drink. Dr.
Locker seems to think vinegar the best medicine
that can be given in this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>Camphire and musk have likewise been used in
this case with advantage. Ten or twelve grains of
camphire may be rubbed in a mortar with half a
drachm of nitre, and taken twice a-day, or oftner,
if the stomach will bear it. If it will not sit upon
the stomach in this form, it may be made into pills
with gum asafœtida and Russian castor, and taken
in the quantity above directed. If musk is to be
administered, a scruple or twenty-five grains of it
may be made into a bolus with a little honey or
common syrup, and taken twice or thrice a-day.
We do not mean that all these medicines should be
administered at once; but whichever of them is
given, must be duly persisted in, and where one
fails another may be tried.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_430'>430</span>As it is very difficult to induce patients in this
disease to take medicines, we shall mention a few
outward applications, which sometimes do good;
the principal of these are issues, setons, and warm
bathing. Issues may be made in any part of the
body, but they generally have the best effect near
the spine. The discharge from these may be greatly
promoted by dressing them with the mild blistering
ointment, and keeping what are commonly called
the orrice pease in them. The most proper place
for a seton is between the shoulder-blades; and it
ought to be placed upwards and downwards, or in
the direction of the spine.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE PALSY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The palsy is a loss or diminution of sense or motion,
or of both, in one or more parts of the body.
Of all the affections called nervous, this is the most
suddenly fatal. It is more or less dangerous, according
to the importance of the part affected. A
palsy of the heart, lungs, or any part necessary to
life, is mortal. When it affects the stomach, the
intestines, or the bladder, it is highly dangerous.
If the face be affected, the case is bad, as it shews
that the disease proceeds from the brain. When
the part affected feels cold, is insensible, or wastes
away, or when the judgment and memory begin to
fail, there is small hope of a cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The immediate cause of palsy is
any thing that prevents the regular exertion of the
nervous power upon any particular muscle or part
of the body. The occasional and predisposing causes
are various, as drunkenness; wounds of the brain,
or spinal marrow; pressure upon the brain or
nerves; very cold or damp air; the suppression of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_431'>431</span>customary evacuations; sudden fear; want of exercise;
or whatever greatly relaxes the system, as
drinking much tea<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c010'><sup>[147]</sup></a>, or coffee, &#38;c. The palsy
may likewise proceed from wounds of the nerves
themselves, from the poisonous fumes of metals or
minerals, as mercury, lead, arsenic.</p>

<p class='c008'>In young persons of a full habit, the palsy must
be treated in the same manner as the sanguine apoplexy.
The patient must be bled, blistered, and
have his body opened by sharp clysters or purgative
medicines. But, in old age, or when the disease
proceeds from relaxation or debility, which is
generally the case, a quite contrary course must be
pursued. The diet must be warm and invigorating,
seasoned with spicy and aromatic vegetables, as
mustard, horse-radish, &#38;c. The drink may be
generous wine, mustard-whey, or brandy and water.
Friction with the flesh-brush, or a warm hand,
is extremely proper, especially on the parts affected.
Blistering-plasters may likewise be applied
to the affected parts with advantage. When this
cannot be done, they may be rubbed with the volatile
liniment, or the nerve ointment of the Edinburgh
dispensatory. One of the best external applications
is electricity. The shocks, or rather vibrations,
should be received on the part affected;
and they ought daily to be repeated for several
weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vomits are very beneficial in this kind of palsy,
and ought frequently to be administered. Cephalic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_432'>432</span>snuff, or any thing that makes the patient sneeze,
is likewise of use. Some pretend to have found
great benefit from rubbing the parts affected with
nettles; but this does not seem to be any way preferable
to blistering. If the tongue is affected, the
patient may gargle his mouth frequently with
brandy and mustard; or he may hold a bit of sugar
in his mouth wet with the palsy-drops or compound
spirits of lavender. The wild valerian-root
is a very proper medicine in this case. It may
either be taken in an infusion with sage-leaves, or
half a drachm of it in powder may be given in a
glass of wine three times a-day. If the patient
cannot use the valerian, he may take of <i>sal volatile
oleosum</i>, compound spirits of lavender, and tincture
of castor, each half an ounce; mix these together,
and take forty or fifty drops in a glass of
wine three or four times a-day. A table-spoonful
of mustard-seed taken frequently is a very good
medicine. The patient ought likewise to chew cinnamon bark,
ginger, or other warm spiceries.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise is of the utmost importance in the palsy;
but the patient must beware of cold, damp, and moist
air. He ought to wear flannel next his skin; and,
if possible, should remove into a warmer climate.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE EPILEPSY, <span class='fss'>OR</span> FALLING SICKNESS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The epilepsy is a sudden deprivation of all the
senses, wherein the patient falls suddenly down,
and is affected with violent convulsive motions.
Children, especially those who are delicately brought
up, are most subject to it. It more frequently attacks
men than women, and is very difficult to cure.
When the epilepsy attacks children, there is reason
to hope it may go off about the time of puberty.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_433'>433</span>When it attacks any person after twenty years of
age, the cure is difficult; but when after forty, a
cure is hardly to be expected. If the fit continues
only for a short space, and returns seldom, there
is reason to hope; but if it continues long, and returns
frequently, the prospect is bad. It is a very
unfavourable symptom when the patient is seized
with the fits in his sleep.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——The epilepsy is sometimes hereditary.
It may likewise proceed from blows, bruises,
or wounds on the head; a collection of water, blood,
or serous humours in the brain; a polypus; tumours
or concretions within the skull; excessive
drinking; intense study; excess of venery; worms;
teething; suppression of customary evacuations;
too great emptiness or repletion; violent passions
or affections of the mind, as fear, joy, &#38;c.; hysteric
affections; contagion received into the body,
as the infection of the small-pox, measles, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——An epileptic fit is generally
preceded by unusual weariness; pain of the head;
dulness; giddiness; noise in the ears; dimness of
sight; palpitation of the heart; disturbed sleep;
difficult breathing; the bowels are inflated with
wind; the urine is in great quantity, but thin; the
complexion is pale; the extremities are cold; and
the patient often feels, as it were, a stream of cold
air ascending towards his head.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the fit, the patient generally makes an unusual
noise; his thumbs are drawn in towards the palms
of the hands; his eyes are distorted; he starts, and
foams at the mouth; his extremities are bent or
twitted various ways; he often discharges his seed,
urine, and fæces involuntarily; and is quite destitute
of all sense and reason. After the fit is over,
his senses gradually return, and he complains of a
kind of stupor, weariness, and pain of his head;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_434'>434</span>but has no remembrance of what happened to him
during the fit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The fits are sometimes excited by violent affections
of the mind, a debauch of liquor, excessive
heat, cold, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease, from the difficulty of investigating
its causes, and its strange symptoms, was formerly
attributed to the wrath of the gods, or the agency
of evil spirits. In modern times it has often, by
the vulgar, been imputed to witchcraft or fascination.
It depends however as much upon natural
causes as any other malady; and its cure may
often be effected by persisting in the use of proper
means.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——Epileptic patients ought, if
possible, to breathe a pure and free air. Their diet
should be light but nourishing. They ought to
drink nothing strong, to avoid swine’s flesh, water-fowl,
and likewise all windy and oily vegetables,
as cabbage, nuts, &#38;c. They ought to
keep themselves cheerful, carefully guarding against
all violent passions, as anger, fear, excessive joy,
and the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Exercise is likewise of great use; but the patient
must be careful to avoid all extremes either of heat
or cold, all dangerous situations, as standing upon
precipices, riding, deep waters, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——The intentions of cure must
vary according to the cause of the disease. If the
patient be of a sanguine temperament, and there be
reason to fear an obstruction in the brain, bleeding
and other evacuations will be necessary. When the
disease is occasioned by the stoppage of customary
evacuations, these, if possible, must be restored; if
this cannot be done, others may be substituted in
their place. Issues or setons in this case have often a
very good effect. When there is reason to believe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_435'>435</span>that the disease proceeds from worms, proper medicines
must be used to kill, or carry off these vermin.
When the disease proceeds from teething,
the body should be kept open by emollient clysters,
the feet frequently bathed in warm water, and, if
the fits prove obstinate, a blistering-plaster may be
put betwixt the shoulders. The same method is to
be followed, when epileptic fits precede the eruption
of the small-pox, or measles, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disease is hereditary, or proceeds from
a wrong formation of the brain, a cure is not to be
expected. When it is owing to a debility, or too
great an irritability of the nervous system, such medicines
as tend to brace and strengthen the nerves
may be used, as the Peruvian bark, and steel; or
the <i>anti-epileptic</i> electuaries, recommended by Fuller
and Mead<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c010'><sup>[148]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The flowers of zinc have of late been highly extolled
for the cure of the epilepsy. Though this
medicine will not be found to answer the expectations
which have been raised concerning it, yet in
obstinate epileptic cases it deserves a trial. The
dose is from one to three or four grains, which may
be taken either in pills or a bolus, as the patient
inclines. The best method is to begin with a single
grain four or five times a day, and gradually to
increase the dose as far as the patient can bear it.
I have known this medicine, when duly persisted
in, prove beneficial.</p>

<p class='c008'>Musk has sometimes been found to succeed in
the epilepsy. Ten or twelve grains of it, with the
same quantity of factitious cinnabar, may be made
up into a bolus, and taken every night and morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the epilepsy has been cured by electricity.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_436'>436</span>Convulsion-fits proceed from the same causes,
and must be treated in the same manner as the epilepsy.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is one particular species of convulsion-fits
which commonly goes by the name of St. Vitus’s
dance, wherein the patient is agitated with strange
motions and gesticulations, which by the common
people are generally believed to be the effects of
witchcraft. This disease may be cured by repeated
bleedings and purges; and afterwards using the
medicines prescribed above for the epilepsy, <i>viz.</i>
the Peruvian bark and snake-root, &#38;c. Chalybeate
waters are found to be beneficial in this case.
The cold bath is likewise of singular service, and
ought never to be neglected when the patient can
bear it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE HICCUP.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The hiccup is a spasmodic or convulsive affection
of the stomach and midriff, arising from any
cause that irritates their nervous fibres.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may proceed from excess in eating or drinking;
from a hurt of the stomach; poisons; inflammations
or scirrhous tumours of the stomach, intestines,
bladder, midriff, or the rest of the <i>viscera</i>.
In gangrenes, acute and malignant fevers, a hiccup
is often the forerunner of death.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the hiccup proceeds from the use of aliment
that is flatulent, or hard of digestion, a draught
of generous wine, or a dram of any spirituous liquor,
will generally remove it. If poison be the
cause, plenty of milk and oil must be drank, as has
been formerly recommended. When it proceeds
from an inflammation of the stomach, &#38;c. it is
very dangerous. In this case the cooling regimen
ought to be strictly observed. The patient must
be bled, and take frequently a few drops of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_437'>437</span>sweet spirits of nitre in a cup of wine-whey. His
stomach should likewise be fomented with cloths
dipped in warm water, or have bladders filled with
warm milk and water applied to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the hiccup proceeds from a gangrene or
mortification, the Peruvian bark, with other antiseptics,
are the only medicines which have a chance
to succeed. When it is a primary disease, and proceeds
from a foul stomach, loaded either with a pituitous
or a bilious humour, a gentle vomit and
purge, if the patient be able to bear them, will be
of service. If it arises from flatulencies, the carminative
medicines directed for the heart-burn
must be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the hiccup proves very obstinate, recourse
must be had to the most powerful aromatic and antispasmodic
medicines. The principal of these is
musk; fifteen or twenty grains of which may be
made into a bolus, and repeated occasionally. Opiates
are likewise of service; but they must be used
with caution. A bit of sugar dipped in compound
spirits of lavender, or the volatile aromatic tincture,
may be taken frequently. External applications
are sometimes also beneficial; as the stomach
plaster, or a cataplasm of the Venice treacle of the
Edinburgh or London dispensatory, applied to the
region of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>I lately attended a patient who had almost a constant
hiccup for above nine weeks. It was frequently
stopped by the use of musk, opium, wine,
and other cordial and antispasmodic medicines, but
always returned. Nothing however gave the patient
so much ease as brisk small-beer. By drinking
freely of this, the hiccup was often kept off
for several days, which was more than could be
done by the most powerful medicines. The patient
was at length seized with a vomiting of blood,
which soon put an end to his life. Upon opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_438'>438</span>the body, a large scirrhous tumour was found near
the pylorus or right orifice of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>The hiccup may be removed by taking vinegar,
or a few drops of the oil of vitriol taken in water.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CRAMP OF THE STOMACH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This disease often seizes people suddenly, is very
dangerous, and requires immediate assistance. It
is most incident to persons in the decline of life,
especially the nervous, gouty, hysteric, and hypochondriac.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the patient has any inclination to vomit, he
ought to take some draughts of warm water, or
weak camomile-tea, to cleanse his stomach. After
this, if he has been costive, a laxative clyster may
be given. He ought then to take laudanum. The
best way of administering it is in a clyster. Sixty
or seventy drops of liquid laudanum may be given
in a clyster of warm water. This is much more
certain than laudanum given by the mouth, which
is often vomited, and in some cases increases the
pain and spasms in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the pain and cramps return with great violence,
after the effects of the anodyne clyster are over, another,
with an equal or a larger quantity of opium,
may be given; and every four or five hours a bolus,
with ten or twelve grains of musk, and half a
drachm of the Venice treacle.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the mean time, the stomach ought to be fomented
with cloths dipped in warm water, or bladders
filled with warm milk and water should be
constantly applied to it. I have often seen these
produce the most happy effects. The anodyne
balsam may also be rubbed on the part affected;
and an anti-hysteric plaster worn upon it for some
time after the cramps are removed, to prevent their
return.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_439'>439</span>In very violent and lasting pains of the stomach,
some blood ought to be let, unless the weakness of
the patient forbids it. When the pain or cramps
proceed from a suppression of the <i>menses</i>, bleeding
is of use. If they be owing to the gout, recourse
must be had to spirits, or some of the warm cordial
waters. Blistering plasters ought likewise in
this case to be applied to the ancles. I have often
seen violent cramps and pains of the stomach removed
by covering it with a large plaster of Venice
treacle.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE NIGHT-MARE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>In this disease the patient, in time of sleep, imagines
he feels an uncommon oppression or weight
about his breast or stomach, which he can by no
means shake off. He groans, and sometimes cries
out, though oftner he attempts to speak in vain.
Sometimes he imagines himself engaged with an
enemy, and in danger of being killed, attempts to
run away, but finds he cannot. Sometimes he fancies
himself in a house that is on fire, or that he is
in danger of being drowned in a river. He often
thinks he is falling over a precipice, and the dread
of being dashed to pieces suddenly awakes him.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disorder has been supposed to proceed from
too much blood; from a stagnation of blood in the
brain, lungs, &#38;c. But it is rather a nervous affection,
and arises chiefly from indigestion. Hence
we find that persons of weak nerves, who lead a sedentary
life, and live full, are most commonly afflicted
with the night-mare. Nothing tends more
to produce it than heavy suppers, especially when
eaten late, or the patient goes to bed soon after.
Wind is likewise a very frequent cause of this disease;
for which reason those who are afflicted with
it ought to avoid all flatulent food. Deep thought,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_440'>440</span>anxiety, or any thing that oppresses the mind, ought
also to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>As persons afflicted with the night-mare generally
moan, or make some noise in the fit, they
should be waked, or spoken to by such as hear
them, as the uneasiness generally goes off as soon
as the patient is awake. Dr. Whytt says, he generally
found a dram of brandy, taken at bed-time,
prevent this disease. That however is a bad custom,
and in time loses its effect. We would rather
have the patient depend upon the use of food of easy
digestion, cheerfulness, exercise through the day,
and a light supper taken early, than to accustom
himself to drams. A glass of peppermint-water
will often promote digestion as much as a glass of
brandy, and is much safer. After a person of weak
digestion, however, has eaten flatulent food, a dram
may be necessary; in this case we would recommend
it as the most proper medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who are young, and full of blood, if
troubled with the night-mare, ought to take a purge
frequently, and use a spare diet.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF SWOONINGS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>People of weak nerves or delicate constitutions
are liable to swoonings or fainting fits. These indeed
are seldom dangerous when duly attended to;
but when wholly neglected, or improperly treated,
they often prove hurtful, and sometimes fatal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general causes of swoonings are, sudden transition
from cold to heat; breathing air that is deprived
of its proper spring or elasticity; great fatigue;
excessive weakness; loss of blood; long
fasting; fear, grief, and other violent passions or
affections of the mind.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is well known, that persons who have been
long exposed to cold, often faint or fall into a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_441'>441</span>swoon, upon coming into the house, especially if
they drink hot liquor, or sit near a large fire. This
might easily be prevented by people taking care not
to go into a warm room immediately after they
have been exposed to the cold air, to approach the
fire gradually, and not to eat or drink any thing
hot, till the body has been gradually brought into
a warm temperature.</p>

<p class='c008'>When any one, in consequence of neglecting
these precautions, falls into a swoon, he ought immediately
to be removed to a cooler apartment, to
have ligatures applied above his knees and elbows,
and to have his hands and face sprinkled with vinegar
or cold water. He should likewise be made to
smell to vinegar, and should have a spoonful or two
of water, if he can swallow, with about a third
part of vinegar mixed with it, poured into his
mouth. If these should not remove the complaint,
it will be necessary to bleed the patient, and afterwards
to give him a clyster.</p>

<p class='c008'>As air that is breathed frequently loses its elasticity
or spring, it is no wonder if persons who respire
in it often fall into a swoon or fainting fit.
They are in this case deprived of the very principle
of life. Hence it is that fainting fits are so frequent
in all crowded assemblies, especially in hot
seasons. Such fits however must be considered as
a kind of temporary death; and, to the weak and
delicate, they sometimes prove fatal. They ought
therefore with the utmost care to be guarded against.
The method of doing this is obvious. Let assembly-rooms,
and all other places of public resort,
be large and well ventilated; and let the weak and
delicate avoid such places, particularly in warm
seasons.</p>

<p class='c008'>A person who faints, in such a situation, ought
immediately to be carried into the open air; his
temples should be rubbed with strong vinegar or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_442'>442</span>brandy, and volatile spirits of salts held to his nose.
He should be laid upon his back with his head
low, and have a little wine, or some other cordial,
as soon as he is able to swallow it, poured
into his mouth. If the person has been subject
to hysteric fits, castor or asafœtida should be applied
to the nose, or burnt feathers, horn, or leather,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When fainting fits proceed from mere weakness
or exhaustion, which is often the case after great
fatigue, long fasting, loss of blood, or the like, the
patient must be supported with generous cordials,
as jellies, wines, spirituous liquors, &#38;c. These
however must be given at first in very small quantities,
and increased gradually as the patient is able
to bear them. He ought to be allowed to lie quite
still and easy upon his back, with his head low,
and should have fresh air admitted into his chamber.
His food should consist of nourishing broths,
sago-gruel with wine, new milk, and other things
of a light and cordial nature. These things are to
be given out of the fit. All that can be done in
the fit is, to let him smell to a bottle of Hungary-water,
<i>eau de luce</i>, or spirits of hartshorn, and to
rub his temples with warm brandy, or to lay a
compress dipped in it to the pit of the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fainting fits that proceed from fear, grief, or
other violent passions or affections of the mind, the
patient must be very cautiously managed. He should
be suffered to remain at rest, and only made to
smell to some vinegar. After he is come to himself
he may drink freely of warm lemonade, or balm-tea,
with some orange or lemon-peel in it. It will
likewise be proper, if the fainting fits have been
long and severe, to clean the bowels by throwing
in an emollient clyster.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is common in fainting fits, from whatever
cause they proceed, to bleed the patient. This
<span class='pageno' id='Page_443'>443</span>practice may be very proper in strong persons of a
full habit; but in those who are weak and delicate,
or subject to nervous disorders, it is dangerous. The
proper method with such people is, to expose them
to the free air, and to use cordial and stimulating
medicines, as volatile salts, Hungary-water, spirits
of lavender, tincture of castor, and the like.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF FLATULENCIES, OR WIND.</h4>

<p class='c018'>All nervous patients, without exception, are afflicted
with wind or flatulencies in the stomach and
bowels, which arise chiefly from the want of tone
or vigour in these organs. Crude flatulent aliment,
as green peas, beans, coleworts, cabbages, and
such like, may increase this complaint; but strong
and healthy people are seldom troubled with wind,
unless they either overload their stomachs, or drink
liquors that are in a fermenting state, and consequently
full of elastic air. While therefore the
matter of flatulence proceeds from our aliments,
the cause which makes air separate from them in
such quantity as to occasion complaints, is almost
always a fault of the bowels themselves, which are
too weak either to prevent the production of elastic
air, or to expel it after it is produced.</p>

<p class='c008'>To relieve this complaint, such medicines ought
to be used as have a tendency to expel wind, and
by strengthening the alimentary canal, to prevent
its being produced there<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c010'><sup>[149]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The list of medicines for expelling wind is very
numerous; they often however disappoint the expectations
<span class='pageno' id='Page_444'>444</span>of both the physician and his patient.
The most celebrated among the class of carminatives
are juniper berries; the roots of ginger and
zedoary; the seeds of anise, caraway, and coriander;
gum asafœtida and opium; the warm waters,
tinctures, and spirits, as the aromatic water, the
tincture of wood-soot, the volatile aromatic spirit,
æther, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Whytt says, he found no medicines more
efficacious in expelling wind than æther and laudanum.
He generally gave the laudanum in a mixture
with peppermint-water and tincture of castor,
or sweet spirits of nitre. Sometimes, in place of
this, he gave opium in pills with asafœtida. He
observes that the good effects of opiates are equally
conspicuous, whether the flatulence be contained
in the stomach or intestines; whereas those warm
medicines, commonly called <i>carminatives</i>, do not
often give immediate relief, except when the wind
is in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to æther, the Doctor says, he has
often seen very good effects from it in flatulent complaints,
where other medicines failed. The dose is
a tea-spoonful mixed with two table-spoonfuls of
water<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c010'><sup>[150]</sup></a>. In gouty cases he observes, that æther, a
glass of French brandy, or of the aromatic water,
or ginger, either taken in substance or infused in
boiling water, are among the best medicines for
expelling wind.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the case of flatulent patients is such as
makes it improper to give them warm medicines inwardly,
the Doctor recommends external applications,
which are sometimes of advantage. Equal
parts of the anti-hysteric and stomach plaster may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_445'>445</span>be spread upon a piece of soft leather, of such size
as to cover the greater part of the belly. This
should be kept on for a considerable time, provided
the patient be able to bear it; if it should give
great uneasiness, it may be taken off, and the following
liniment used in its stead:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of Bates’s anodyne balsam an ounce; of
the expressed oil of mace half an ounce; oil of
mint two drachms. Let these ingredients be mixed
together, and about a table-spoonful well rubbed
on the parts at bed-time.</p>

<p class='c008'>For strengthening the stomach and bowels, and
consequently for lessening the production of flatulence,
the Doctor recommends the Peruvian bark,
bitters, chalybeates, and exercise. In flatulent
cases, he thinks some nutmeg or ginger should be
added to the tincture of the bark and bitters, and
that the aromatic powder should be joined with the
filings of iron.</p>

<p class='c008'>When windy complaints are attended with costiveness,
which is often the case, few things will be
found to answer better than four or five of the following
pills taken every night at bed-time:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of asafœtida two drachms; succotorine aloes,
salt of iron, and powdered ginger, of each one
drachm; as much of the <i>elixir proprietatis</i> as will be
sufficient to form them into pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the other hand, when the body is too open,
twelve or fifteen grains of rhubarb, with half a
drachm or two scruples of the Japonic confection,
given every other evening, will have very good
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>In those flatulent complaints which come on
about the time the <i>menses</i> cease, repeated small
bleedings often give more relief than any other
remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to diet, the Doctor observes, that
tea, and likewise all flatulent aliments, are to be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_446'>446</span>avoided; and that for drink, water with a little
brandy or rum is not only preferable to malt liquor,
but in most cases also to wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>As Dr. Whytt has paid great attention to this
subject, and as his sentiments upon it in a great
measure agree with mine, I have taken the liberty
to adopt them; and shall only add to his observations,
that exercise is in my opinion superior to all
medicine, both for preventing the production and
likewise for expelling of flatulencies. These effects,
however, are not to be expected from sauntering
about, or lolling in a carriage; but from labour,
or such active amusements as give exercise to every
part of the body.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF LOW SPIRITS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>All who have weak nerves are subject to low spirits
in a greater or less degree. Generous diet, the
cold bath, exercise, and amusements, are the most
likely means to remove this complaint. It is
greatly increased by solitude and indulging gloomy
ideas; but may often be relieved by cheerful company
and sprightly amusements.</p>

<p class='c008'>When low spirits are owing to a weak relaxed
state of the stomach and bowels, an infusion of the
Peruvian bark with cinnamon or nutmeg will be
proper. Steel joined with aromatics may likewise
in this case be used with advantage; but riding,
and a proper diet, are most to be depended on.</p>

<p class='c008'>When they arise from a foulness of the stomach
and intestines, or obstruction in the hypochondriac
viscera, aloetic purges will be proper. I have
sometimes known the Harrowgate sulphur-water of
service in this case.</p>

<p class='c008'>When low spirits proceed from a suppression of
the menstrual or of the hæmorrhoidal flux, these
evacuations may either be restored, or some others
<span class='pageno' id='Page_447'>447</span>substituted in their place, as issues, setons, or the
like. Dr. Whytt observes, that nothing has such
sudden good effects in this case as bleeding.</p>

<p class='c008'>When low spirits have been brought on by long-continued
grief, anxiety, or other distress of mind,
agreeable company, variety of amusements, and
change of place, especially travelling into foreign
countries, will afford the most certain relief.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons afflicted with low spirits should avoid all
kinds of excess, especially of venery and strong liquors.
The moderate use of wine and other strong
liquors is by no means hurtful; but when taken to
excess they weaken the stomach, vitiate the humours,
and depress the spirits. This caution is
the more necessary, as the unfortunate and melancholy
often fly to strong liquors for relief, by which
means they never fail to precipitate their own destruction.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF HYSTERIC AFFECTIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>These likewise belong to the numerous tribe of
nervous diseases, which may be justly reckoned the
reproach of medicine. Women of a delicate habit,
whose stomach and intestines are relaxed, and
whose nervous system is extremely sensible, are most
subject to hysteric complaints. In such persons a
hysteric fit, as it is called, may be brought on by
an irritation of the nerves of the stomach or intestines,
by wind, acrid humour, or the like. A sudden
suppression of the <i>menses</i> often gives rise to
hysteric fits. They may likewise be excited by
violent passions or affections of the mind, as fear,
grief, anger, or great disappointments.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes the hysteric fit resembles a swoon or
fainting fit, during which the patient lies as in a
sleep, only the breathing is so low as scarce to be
perceived. At other times the patient is affected
with catchings and strong convulsions. The symptoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_448'>448</span>which precede hysteric fits are likewise various
in different persons. Sometimes the fits come
on with coldness of the extremities, yawning and
stretching, lowness of spirits, oppression and anxiety.
At other times the approach of the fit is
foretold by a feeling, as if there were a ball at the
lower part of the belly, which gradually rises towards
the stomach, where it occasions inflation,
sickness, and sometimes vomiting; afterwards it
rises into the gullet, and occasions a degree of suffocation,
to which quick breathing, palpitation of
the heart, giddiness of the head, dimness of the
sight, loss of hearing, with convulsive motions of
the extremities and other parts of the body, succeed.
The hysteric paroxysm is often introduced
by an immoderate fit of laughter, and sometimes it
goes off by crying. Indeed there is not much difference
between the laughing and crying of an
highly hysteric lady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Our aim in the treatment of this disease must be
to shorten the fit or paroxysm when present, and to
prevent its return. The longer the fits continue,
and the more frequently they return, the disease
becomes the more obstinate. Their strength is increased
by habit, and they induce so great a relaxation
of the system, that it is with difficulty removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is customary, during the hysteric fit or paroxysm,
to bleed the patient. In strong persons of
a plethoric habit, and where the pulse is full, this
may be proper; but in weak and delicate constitutions,
or where the disease has been of long standing,
or arises from inanition, it is not safe. The
best course in such cases is to rouse the patient by
strong smells, as burnt feathers, asafœtida, or spirits
of hartshorn, held to the nose. Hot bricks
may also be applied to the soles of the feet, and the
legs, arms, and belly may be strongly rubbed with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_449'>449</span>a warm cloth. But the best application is to put
the feet and legs into warm water. This is peculiarly
proper when the fits precede the flow of the
menses. In case of costiveness, a laxative clyster
with asafœtida will be proper; and as soon as the
patient can swallow, two table-spoonfuls of a solution
of asafœtida, or of some cordial julep, may
be given<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c010'><sup>[151]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The radical cure of this disorder will be best attempted
at a time when the patient is most free
from the fits. It will be greatly promoted by a
proper attention to diet. A milk and vegetable
diet, when duly persisted in, will often perform a
cure. If however the patient has been accustomed
to a more generous diet, it will not be safe to leave
it off all at once, but by degrees. The most proper
drink is water with a small quantity of spirits.
A cool dry air is the best. Cold bathing and every
thing that braces the nerves, and invigorates the
system, is beneficial; but lying too long in bed,
or whatever relaxes the body, is hurtful. It is of
the greatest importance to have the mind kept constantly
easy and cheerful, and, if possible, to have
it always engaged in some agreeable and interesting
pursuit.</p>

<p class='c008'>The proper medicines are those which strengthen
the alimentary canal and the whole nervous system,
as the preparations of iron, the Peruvian bark, and
other bitters. Twenty drops of the elixir of vitriol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_450'>450</span>in a cup of the infusion of the bark, may
be taken twice or thrice a day. The bark and
iron may likewise be taken in substance, provided
the stomach can bear them; but they are generally
given in too small doses to have any effect. The
chalybeate waters generally prove beneficial in this
disorder.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the stomach is loaded with phlegm, vomits
will be of use; but they should not be too strong,
nor frequently repeated, as they tend to relax and
weaken the stomach. If there be a tendency to
costiveness, it must be removed either by diet, or
by taking an opening pill as often as it shall be
found necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>To lessen the irritability of the system, antispasmodic
medicines will be of use. The best antispasmodic
medicines are musk, opium, and castor.
When opium disagrees with the stomach, it may either
be applied externally, or given in clysters. It
is often successful in removing those periodical
head-achs to which hysteric and hypochondriac patients
are subject. Castor has in some cases been
found to procure sleep where opium failed; for
which reason Dr. Whytt advises, that they should be
joined together. He likewise recommends the anti-hysteric
plaster to be applied to the <i>abdomen</i><a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c010'><sup>[152]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hysteric women are often afflicted with cramps
in various parts of the body, which are most apt
to seize them in bed, or when asleep. The most
efficacious medicines in this case are opium, blistering-plasters,
and warm bathing or fomentations.
When the cramp or spasm is very violent, opium is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_451'>451</span>the remedy most to be depended on. In milder
cases, immersing the feet and legs in warm water,
or applying a blistering-plaster to the part affected,
will often be sufficient to remove the complaint. In
patients whose nerves are uncommonly delicate and
sensible, it will be better to omit the blistering-plaster,
and to attempt the cure by opiates, musk,
camphire, and the warm bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cramps are often prevented or cured by compression.
Thus cramps in the legs are prevented, and
sometimes removed, by tight bandages; and when
convulsions arise from a flatulent distention of the
intestines, or from spasms beginning in them, they
may be often lessened or cured by making a pretty
strong compression upon the <i>abdomen</i> by means of a
broad belt. A roll of brimstone held in the hand
is frequently used as a remedy for cramps. Though
this seems to owe its effect chiefly to imagination;
yet, as it sometimes succeeds, it merits a trial<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c010'><sup>[153]</sup></a>.
When spasms or convulsive motions arise from
sharp humours in the stomach and intestines, no
lasting relief can be procured till these are either
corrected or expelled. The Peruvian bark has
sometimes cured periodic convulsions after other
medicines had failed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF HYPOCHONDRIAC AFFECTIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This disease generally attacks the indolent, the
luxurious, the unfortunate, and the studious. It
becomes daily more common in this country, owing,
no doubt, to the increase of luxury and sedentary
employments. It has so near a resemblance to the
immediately preceding, that many authors consider
<span class='pageno' id='Page_452'>452</span>them as the same disease, and treat them accordingly.
They require however a very different regimen;
and the symptoms of the latter, though
less violent, are more permanent than those of the
former.</p>

<p class='c008'>Men of a melancholy temperament, whose minds
are capable of great attention, and whose passions
are not easily moved, are, in the advanced periods
of life, most liable to this disease. It is usually
brought on by long and serious attention to abstruse
subjects, grief, the suppression of customary
evacuations, excess of venery, the repulsion of cutaneous
eruptions, long-continued evacuations, obstructions
in some of the viscera, as the liver, spleen,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hypochondriac persons ought never to fast long,
and their food should be solid and nourishing. All
acescent and windy vegetables are to be avoided.
Flesh-meats agree best with them, and their drink
should be old claret, or good madeira. Should
these disagree with the stomach, water with a little
brandy or rum in it may be drank.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cheerfulness and serenity of mind are by all
means to be cultivated. Exercise of every kind
is useful. The cold bath is likewise beneficial;
and, where it does not agree with the patient, frictions
with the flesh-brush or a coarse cloth may be
tried. If the patient has it in his power, he ought
to travel either by sea or land. A voyage or a long
journey, especially towards a warmer climate, will
be of more service than any medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The general intentions of cure, in this disease,
are to strengthen the alimentary canal, and to promote
the secretions. These intentions will be best
answered by the different preparations of iron and
the Peruvian bark, which, after proper evacuations,
may be taken in the same manner as directed in the
preceding disease.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_453'>453</span>If the patient be costive, it will be necessary to
make use of some gentle opening medicine, as
pills composed of equal parts of aloes, rhubarb,
and asafœtida, with as much of the elixir proprietatis
as is necessary to form the ingredients into
pills. Two, three, or four of these may be taken
as often as it shall be found needful, to keep the
body gently open. Such as cannot bear the asafœtida
may substitute Spanish soap in its place.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though a cheerful glass may have good effects
in this disease, yet all manner of excess is hurtful.
Intense study, and every thing that depresses the
spirits, are likewise pernicious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the general symptoms and treatment of
nervous disorders were pointed out in the beginning
of this chapter; yet, for the benefit of the
unhappy persons afflicted with those obstinate and
complicated maladies, I have treated several of
their capital symptoms under distinct or separate
heads. These however are not to be considered as
different diseases, but as various modifications of
the same disease. They all arise from the same general
causes, and require nearly the same method
of treatment. There are many other symptoms
that merit particular attention, which the nature of
my plan will not permit me to treat of at full
length. I shall therefore omit them altogether,
and conclude this chapter with a few general remarks
on the most obvious means of preventing or
avoiding nervous disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all persons afflicted with nervous disorders,
there is a great delicacy and sensibility of the whole
nervous system, and an uncommon degree of weakness
of the organs of digestion. These may be
either natural or acquired. When owing to a defect
in the constitution, they are hardly to be removed;
but may be mitigated by proper care.
When induced by diseases, as long or repeated fevers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_454'>454</span>profuse hæmorrhages, or the like, they prove
also very obstinate, and will yield only to a course
of regimen calculated to restore and invigorate the
habit.</p>

<p class='c008'>But nervous affections arise more frequently from
causes, which it is in a great measure in our own
power to avoid, than from diseases, or an original
fault in the constitution, &#38;c. Excessive grief, intense
study, improper diet, and neglect of exercise,
are the great sources of this extensive class of
diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been already observed, that grief indulged
destroys the appetite and digestion, depresses the
spirits, and induces an universal relaxation and debility
of the whole system. Instances of this are
daily to be seen. The loss of a near relation, or
any other misfortune in life, is often sufficient to
occasion the most complicated series of nervous
symptoms. Such misfortunes indeed are not to be
avoided, but surely their effects, by a vigorous and
proper exertion of the mind, might be rendered
less hurtful. For directions in this matter we must
refer the reader to the article <span class='sc'>Grief</span>, in the chapter
on the passions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The effects of intense study are pretty similar to
those occasioned by grief. It preys upon the animal
spirits, and destroys the appetite and digestion.
To prevent these effects, studious persons ought,
according to the Poet, <i>to toy with their books</i><a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c010'><sup>[154]</sup></a>.
They should never study too long at a time; nor
attend long to one particular subject, especially if
it be of a serious nature. They ought likewise to
be attentive to their posture, and should take care
frequently to unbend their minds by music, diversions,
or going into agreeable company.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_455'>455</span>With regard to diet, I shall only observe, that
nervous diseases may be induced either by excess or
inanition. Both of these extremes hurt indigestion,
and vitiate the humours. When Nature is oppressed
with fresh loads of food, before she has had
time to digest and assimilate the former meal, her
powers are weakened, and the vessels are filled with
crude humours. On the other hand, when the
food is not sufficiently nourishing, or is taken too
seldom, the bowels are inflated with wind, and
the humours, for want of regular fresh supplies of
wholesome chyle, are vitiated. These extremes
are therefore with equal care to be avoided. They
both tend to induce a relaxation, and debility of
the nervous system, with all its dreadful train of
consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the most general cause of nervous disorders
is <i>indolence</i>. The active and laborious are seldom
troubled with them. They are reserved for the
children of ease and affluence, who generally feel
their keenest force. All we shall say to such persons
is, that the means of prevention and cure are
both in their own power. If the constitution of
human nature be such, that man must either labour
or suffer diseases, surely no individual has any
right to expect an exemption from the general
rule.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those however who are willing to take exercise,
but whose occupations confine them to the house,
and perhaps to an unfavourable posture, really deserve
our pity. We have in a former part of the
book endeavoured to lay down rules for their conduct;
and shall only add, that where these cannot
be complied with, their place may, in some measure,
be supplied by the use of bracing and strengthening
medicines, as the Peruvian bark, with other
bitters; the preparations of steel; the elixir of vitriol,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>We do not mean to treat of the nature of our
sensations, or to give a minute description of
the various organs by which they are performed;
but to point out some of the diseases to which these
organs are most liable, and to shew how they may
be prevented or remedied.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE EYE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>No organ of the body is subject to more diseases
than the eye; nor is there any one of which the
diseases are more difficult to cure. Though more
ignorant persons pretend to cure these than any
other class of diseases; yet a very superficial acquaintance
with the structure of the eye, and the
nature of vision, will be sufficient to convince any
one of the danger of trusting to them. These diseases
often exceed the skill of the most learned
physician; hence we may easily infer the danger
of trusting them to ignorant quacks, who, without
all peradventure, put out more eyes than they cure.
But, though the diseases of the eye can seldom be
cured, they might often, by due care, be prevented;
and, even where the sight is totally lost,
many things might be done, which are generally
neglected, to render the unhappy person both more
useful to himself and to society<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c010'><sup>[155]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_457'>457</span>The eyes are hurt by viewing bright or luminous
objects; keeping the head too long in a hanging
posture; violent head-achs; excessive venery; the
long use of bitters; the effluvia from acrid or volatile
substances; various diseases; as the small-pox,
measles, &#38;c. but, above all, from night-watching,
and candle-light studies. Long fasting
is likewise hurtful to the eyes, and frequent heats
and colds are no less pernicious. The eyes are
often hurt by the stoppage of customary evacuations;
as morning sweats; sweating of the feet; the
menses in women; and the bleeding piles in men.
All kinds of excess are likewise hurtful to the sight,
particularly the immoderate use of ardent spirits
and other strong liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all diseases of the eyes, especially those attended
with inflammation, the cool regimen ought
to be observed. The patient must abstain from all
spirituous liquors. The smoke of tobacco, smoky
rooms, the vapours of onions and garlic, and all
vivid lights and glaring colours, are carefully to
be avoided. The drink may be water, whey, or
small beer; and the aliment must be light and of
easy digestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>For preventing disorders of the eyes, issues and
setons are of prime use. Every person, whose eyes
are tender, ought to have one or more of these in
some part of the body. It will likewise be of use
to keep the body gently open, and either to bleed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_458'>458</span>or purge every spring and fall. All excess and
night studies are to be avoided. Such as do not
chuse a seton or an issue, will find benefit from
wearing a small Burgundy-pitch plaster between
their shoulders.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>gutta serena</i>, or <i>amaurosis</i>, is an abolition of
the sight without any apparent cause or fault in the
eyes. When it is owing to a decay or wasting of
the optic nerve, it does not admit of a cure; but
when it proceeds from a compression of the nerves
by redundant humours, these may in some measure
be drained off, and the patient relieved. For
this purpose, the body must be kept open with the
laxative mercurial pills. If the patient be young
and of a sanguine habit, he may be bled. Cupping,
with scarifications on the back part of the
head, will likewise be of use. A running at the
nose may be promoted by volatile salts, stimulating
powders, &#38;c. But the most likely means for relieving
the patient are issues or blisters kept open
for a long time on the back part of the head, behind
the ears, or on the neck. I have known these
restore sight, even after it had been for a considerable
time lost.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should these fail, recourse must be had to a mercurial
salivation; or what will perhaps answer the
purpose better, twelve grains of the corrosive sublimate
of mercury may be dissolved in an English
pint and a half of brandy, and a table-spoonful of
it taken twice a-day, drinking half a pint of the
decoction of sarsaparilla after it.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>cataract</i> is an obstruction of the pupil, by the
interposition of some opaque substance which either
diminishes or totally extinguishes the sight. It is
generally an opacity of the crystalline humour. In
a recent or beginning cataract, the same medicines
are to be used as in the gutta serena; and they will
sometimes succeed. But when this does not happen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_459'>459</span>and the cataract becomes firm, it must be
couched, or rather extracted. I have resolved a
recent cataract by giving the patient frequent purges
with calomel, keeping a poultice of fresh hemlock
constantly upon the eye, and a perpetual blister on
the neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>myopia</i>, or <i>short sightedness</i>, and the <i>presbyopia</i>,
or <i>seeing only at too great a distance</i>, are disorders
which depend on the original structure or figure of
the eye, therefore admit of no cure. The inconveniencies
arising from them may however be, in
some measure, remedied by the help of proper
glasses. The former requires the aid of a concave,
and the latter of a convex glass.</p>

<p class='c008'>A <i>strabismus</i>, or <i>squinting</i>, depends upon an irregular
contraction of the muscles of the eye from a
spasm, palsy, epilepsy, or an ill habit. Children
often contract this disorder by having their eyes
unequally exposed to the light. They may likewise
acquire it by imitation from a squinting nurse
or play-fellow, &#38;c. As this disorder can hardly
be cured, parents ought to be careful to prevent
it. Almost the only thing which can be done for
it is, to contrive a mask for the child to wear,
which will only permit him to see in a straight direction.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Spots</i> or <i>specks</i> on the eyes are generally the effect
of inflammation, and often appear after the small-pox,
the measles, or violent ophthalmias. They are
very difficult to cure, and often occasion total
blindness. If the specks are soft and thin, they
may sometimes be taken off by gentle caustics and
discutients; as vitriol, the juice of celandine, &#38;c.
When these do not succeed, a surgical operation
may be tried: the success of this however is always
very doubtful.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>blood-shot</i> eye may be occasioned by a stroke,
a fall, retching, vomiting, violent coughing, &#38;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_460'>460</span>I have frequently known it happen to children in
the hooping-cough. It appears at first like a bit of
scarlet, and is afterwards of a livid or blackish colour.
This disorder generally goes off without
medicine. Should it prove obstinate, the patient
may be bled, and have his eyes fomented with a
decoction of comphrey roots and elder flowers. A
soft poultice may be applied to the eyes; and the
body should be kept open by gentle purgatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>watery</i>, or <i>weeping eye</i>, is generally occasioned
by a relaxation or weakness of the glandular
parts of that organ. These may be braced and
strengthened by bathing the eye with brandy and
water, Hungary-water, rose-water with white vitriol
dissolved in it, &#38;c. Medicines which make
a revulsion are likewise proper; as mild purgatives,
perpetual blisters on the neck, bathing the
feet frequently in lukewarm water, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this disease proceeds from an obstruction
of the lachrymal duct, or natural passage of the
tears, it is called a <i>fistula lachrymalis</i>, and can only
be cured by a surgical operation.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE EAR.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The functions of the ear may be injured by
wounds, ulcers, or any thing that hurts its fabric.
The hearing may likewise be hurt by excessive noise;
violent colds in the head; fevers; hard wax, or
other substances sticking in the cavity of the ear;
too great a degree of moisture or dryness of the ear.
Deafness is very often the effect of old age, and is
incident to most people in the decline of life.
Sometimes it is owing to an original fault in the
structure or formation of the ear itself. When this
is the case, it admits of no cure; and the unhappy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_461'>461</span>person not only continues deaf, but generally likewise
dumb, for life<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c010'><sup>[156]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When deafness is the effect of wounds or ulcers
of the ears, or of old age, it is not easily removed.
When it proceeds from cold of the head, the patient
must be careful to keep his head warm, especially
in the night; he should likewise take some gentle
purges, and keep his feet warm, and bathe them
frequently in lukewarm water at bed-time. When
deafness is the effect of a fever, it generally goes
off after the patient recovers. If it proceeds from
dry wax sticking in the ears, it may be softened
by dropping oil into them; afterwards they must
be syringed with warm milk and water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_462'>462</span>If deafness proceeds from dryness of the ears,
which may be known by looking into them, half
an ounce of the oil of sweet almonds, and the
same quantity of liquid apodeldoch, or tincture of
asafœtida, may be mixed together, and a few drops
of it put into the ear every night at bed-time,
stopping them afterwards with a little wool or cotton.
Some, instead of oil, put a small slice of the
fat of bacon into each ear, which is said to answer
the purpose very well. When the ears abound with
moisture, it may be drained off by an issue or seton,
which should be made as near the affected
parts as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some, for the cure of deafness, recommend the
gall of an eel mixed with spirit of wine, to be
dropped into the ear; others, equal parts of Hungary-water
and spirit of lavender. Etmuller extols
amber and musk; and Brookes says, he has
often known hardness of hearing cured by putting
a grain or two of musk into the ear with cottonwool.
But these and other applications must be
varied according to the cause of the disorder<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c010'><sup>[157]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though such applications may sometimes be of
service, yet they much oftner fail, and frequently
they do hurt. Neither the eyes nor ears ought to
be tampered with; they are tender organs, and require
a very delicate touch. For this reason, what
we would chiefly recommend in deafness, is, to keep
the head warm. From whatever cause the disorder
proceeds, this is always proper; and I have known
more benefit from it alone, in the most obstinate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_463'>463</span>cases of deafness, than from all the medicines I
ever used.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE TASTE AND SMELL.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though these senses are not of so great importance
to man in a state of society, as the sight and
hearing; yet, as the loss of them is attended with
some inconveniency, they deserve our notice. They
are seldom to be restored when lost; which ought
to make us very attentive to their preservation, by
carefully avoiding whatever may in the least prove
injurious to them. As there is a very great affinity
between the organs of tasting and smelling, whatever
hurts the one generally affects the other.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luxury is highly injurious to these organs.
When the nose and palate are frequently stimulated
by fragrant and poignant dishes, they soon
lose the power of distinguishing tastes and odours
with any degree of nicety. Man, in a state of
nature, may perhaps have these faculties as acute
as any other animal.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sense of smelling may be diminished or destroyed
by diseases; as, the moisture, dryness, inflammation
or suppuration of that membrane which
lines the inside of the nose, commonly called the
olfactory membrane; the compression of the nerves
which supply this membrane, or some fault in the
brain itself at their origin. A defect, or too great
a degree of solidity, of the small spungy bones of
the upper jaw, the caverns of the forehead, &#38;c.
may likewise impair the sense of smelling. It may
also be injured by a collection of fœtid matter in
those caverns, which keeps constantly exhaling
from them. Few things are more hurtful to the
sense of smelling than taking great quantities of
snuff.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_464'>464</span>When the nose abounds with moisture, after
gentle evacuations, such things as tend to take off
irritation, and coagulate the thin sharp serum, may
be applied; as the oil of anise mixed with fine
flour; camphire dissolved in oil of almonds, &#38;c.
The vapours of amber, frankincense, gum-mastic,
and benjamin, may likewise be received into the
nose and mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>For moistening the mucus when it is too dry,
some recommend snuff made of the leaves of marjoram,
mixed with the oil of amber, marjoram
and aniseed; or a sternutatory of calcined white
vitriol; twelve grains of which may be mixed with
two ounces of marjoram-water, and filtrated. The
steam or vapour of vinegar upon hot iron received
up the nostrils is likewise of use for softening the
mucus, opening obstructions, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there is an ulcer in the nose, it ought to be
dressed with some emollient ointment, to which, if
the pain be very great, a little laudanum may be
added. If it be a venereal ulcer, it is not to be
cured without mercury. In that case, the solution
of the corrosive sublimate in brandy may be taken,
as directed in the gutta serena. The ulcer ought
likewise to be washed with it; and the fumes of cinnabar
may be received up the nostrils.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there be reason to suspect that the nerves
which supply the organs of smelling are inert, or
want stimulating, volatile salts, strong snuffs, and
other things which occasion sneezing, may be applied
to the nose. The forehead may likewise be
anointed with balsam of Peru, to which may be
added a little of the oil of amber.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>taste</i> may be diminished by crusts, filth,
mucus, aphthæ, pellicles, warts, &#38;c. covering the
tongue: it may be depraved by a fault of the saliva,
which, being discharged into the mouth, gives the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_465'>465</span>same sensation as if the food which the person takes
had really a bad taste; or it may be entirely destroyed
by injuries done to the nerves of the tongue
and palate. Few things prove more hurtful either
to the sense of tasting or smelling than obstinate
colds, especially those which affect the head.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the taste is diminished by filth, mucus,
&#38;c. the tongue ought to be scraped and frequently
washed with a mixture of water, vinegar, and honey,
or some other detergent. When the saliva is
vitiated, which seldom happens unless in fevers or
other diseases, the curing of the disorder is the
cure of this symptom. To relieve it however in the
mean time, the following things may be of use;
if there be a bitter taste, it may be taken away by
vomits, purges, and other things which evacuate
bile. What is called a nidorous taste, arising from
putrid humours, is corrected by the juice of citrons,
oranges, and other acids. A salt taste is
cured by plentiful dilution with watery liquors. An
acid taste is destroyed by absorbents, and alkaline
salts, as powder of oyster-shells, salt of wormwood,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the sensibility of the nerves which supply
the organs of taste is diminished, the chewing of
horse-radish, or other stimulating substances, will
help to recover it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE TOUCH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The sense of touching may be hurt by any thing
that obstructs the nervous influence, or prevents its
being regularly conveyed to the organs of touching;
as pressure, extreme cold, &#38;c. It may likewise
be hurt by too great a degree of sensibility,
when the nerve is not sufficiently covered by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_466'>466</span>cuticle or scarf-skin, or where there is too great a
tension of it, or it is too delicate. Whatever disorders
the functions of the brain and nerves, hurts
the sense of touching. Hence it appears to proceed
from the same general causes as palsy and
apoplexy, and requires nearly the same method of
treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>In a <i>stupor</i>, or defect of touching, which arises
from an obstruction of the cutaneous nerves, the
patient must first be purged; afterwards such medicines
as excite the action of the nerves, or stimulate
the system, may be used. For this purpose,
the spirit of hartshorn, <i>sal volatile oleosum</i>,
horse-radish, &#38;c. may be taken inwardly; the disordered
parts, at the same time, may be frequently
rubbed with fresh nettles or spirit of <i>sal ammoniac</i>.
Blistering-plasters and sinapisms applied to the parts
will likewise be of use, as also warm bathing, especially
in the natural hot baths.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF A SCIRRHUS AND CANCER.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A scirrhus is a hard indolent tumour seated
in some of the glands; as the breasts, the armpits,
&#38;c. If the tumour becomes large, unequal,
of a livid, blackish, or leaden colour, and is attended
with violent pain, it gets the name of an
<i>occult cancer</i>. When the skin is broken, and a
<i>sanies</i> or ichorous matter of an abominably fœtid
smell is discharged from the sore, it is called an
open or ulcerated cancer. Persons after the age of
forty-five, particularly women, and those who lead
<span class='pageno' id='Page_467'>467</span>an indolent sedentary life, are most subject to this
disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——This disease is often owing to
suppressed evacuations; hence it proves so frequently
fatal to women of a gross habit, particularly
old maids and widows, about the time when
the menstrual flux ceases. It may likewise be occasioned
by excessive fear, grief, anger, religious
melancholy, or any of the depressing passions.
Hence the unfortunate, the choleric, and those
persons who devote themselves to a religious life
in convents or monasteries, are often afflicted with
it. It may also be occasioned by the long-continued
use of food that is too hard of digestion, or
of an acrid nature; by barrenness; celibacy; indolence;
cold; blows; friction; pressure; or the
like. Women often suffer from the last of these
by means of their stays, which squeeze and compress
their breast so as to occasion great mischief.
Sometimes the disease is owing to an hereditary
disposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——This disorder seems often
very trifling at the beginning. A hard tumour
about the size of a hazle-nut, or perhaps smaller,
is generally the first symptom. This will often
continue for a long time without seeming to increase,
or giving the patient great uneasiness; but
if the constitution be hurt, or the tumour irritated
by pressure, or improper treatment of any kind, it
begins to extend itself towards the neighbouring
parts by pushing out a kind of roots or limbs.
It then gets the name of <i>cancer</i>, from a fancied
resemblance between these limbs and the claws of
a crab. The colour of the skin begins to change,
which is first red, afterwards purple, then bluish,
livid, and at last black. The patient complains
of heat, with a burning, gnawing, shooting pain.
The tumour is very hard, rough, and unequal, with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_468'>468</span>a protuberance, or rising, in the middle; its size
increases daily, and the neighbouring veins become
thick, knotty, and of a blackish colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>The skin at length gives way, and a thin sharp
ichor begins to flow, which corrodes the neighbouring
parts till it forms a large unsightly ulcer. More
occult cancers arise, and communicate with the
neighbouring glands. The pain and stench become
intolerable; the appetite fails; the strength
is exhausted by a continual hectic fever; at last, a
violent hæmorrhage, or discharge of blood, from
some part of the body, with faintings, or convulsion
fits, generally put an end to the miserable patient’s
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——The diet ought to be light, but
nourishing. All strong liquors, and high-seasoned
or salted provisions, are to be avoided. The patient
may take as much exercise as he can easily bear;
and should use every method to divert thought,
and amuse his fancy. All kinds of external injury
are carefully to be guarded against, particularly of
the affected part, which ought to be defended from
all pressure, and even from the external air, by covering
it with fur or soft flannel.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——This is one of those diseases
for which no certain remedy is yet known. Its
progress however may sometimes be retarded, and
some of its most disagreeable symptoms mitigated,
by proper applications. One misfortune attending
the disease is, that the unhappy patient often conceals
it too long. Were proper means used in due
time, a cancer might often be cured; but after the
disorder has arrived at a certain height, it generally
sets all medicine at defiance.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a scirrhous tumour is first discovered, the
patient ought to observe a proper regimen, and to
take twice or thrice a-week a dose of the common
purging mercurial pill. Some blood may also be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_469'>469</span>let, and the part affected may be gently rubbed
twice a-day with a little of the mercurial ointment,
and kept warm with fur or flannel. The food must
be light, and an English pint of the decoction of
woods or sarsaparilla may be drank daily. I have
sometimes discussed hard tumours, which had the
appearance of beginning cancers, by a course of
this kind.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should the tumour however not yield to this
treatment, but, on the contrary, become larger and
harder, it will be proper to extirpate it, either by
the knife or caustic. Indeed, whenever this can
be done with safety, the sooner it is done the better.
It can answer no purpose to extirpate a cancer
after the constitution is ruined, or the whole mass
of humours corrupted by it. This however is the
common way, which makes the operation so seldom
succeed. Few people will submit to the extirpation
till death stares them in the face; whereas, if
it were done early, the patient’s life would not be
endangered by the operation, and it would generally
prove a radical cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the cancer is so situated that it cannot be
cut off, or if the patient will not submit to the
operation, such medicines as will mitigate or relieve
the most urgent symptoms may be used. Dr.
Home says, that half a grain of the corrosive sublimate
of mercury, dissolved in a proper quantity of
brandy, and taken night and morning, will often be
of service in cancers of the face and nose. He likewise
recommends an infusion of the <i>solanum</i>, or
night-shade, in cancers of the breasts.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the medicine most in repute at present for
this disease is hemlock. Dr. Stork, physician at
Vienna, has of late recommended the extract of this
plant as very efficacious in cancers of every kind.
The Doctor says, he has given some hundred
weights of it without ever hurting any body, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_470'>470</span>often with manifest advantage. He advises the patient
however to begin with very small doses, as
two or three grains, and to increase the dose gradually
till some good effect be perceived, and there
to rest without further increase. From two or three
grains at first, the Doctor says he has increased the
dose to two, three, or four drachms a-day, and
finds that such doses may be continued for several
weeks without any bad consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>The regimen which the Doctor recommends during
the use of the medicine, is to avoid farinaceous
substances not fermented, and too acrid aromatics.
He says, good wine will not be hurtful to
those who are accustomed to it, nor a moderate use
of acids; and adds, that the patient should live in
a pure free air, and keep his mind as quiet and
cheerful as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor does not pretend to fix the time in
which a cancer may be resolved by the use of hemlock,
but says he has given it for above two years
in large doses without any apparent benefit; nevertheless
the patient has been cured by persisting in
the use of it for half a year longer. This is at least
encouragement to give it a fair trial. Though we
are far from thinking the hemlock merits those extravagant
encomiums which the Doctor has bestowed
upon it, yet, in a disease which has so long
baffled the boasted powers of medicine, we think it
ought always to be tried.</p>

<p class='c008'>The powder of hemlock is by some preferred to
the extract. They are both made of the fresh leaves,
and may be used nearly in the same manner. Dr.
Nicholson of Berwick says, he gradually increased
the dose of the powder from a few grains to half a
drachm, and gave near four drachms of it in the
day with remarkably good effects. The hemlock
may also be used externally either as a poultice or
fomentation. The sore may likewise be kept clean
<span class='pageno' id='Page_471'>471</span>by injecting daily a strong decoction of the tops
and leaves into it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things contribute more to the healing of
foul sordid ulcers of any kind than keeping them
thoroughly clean. This ought never to be neglected.
The best application for this purpose
seems to be the carrot poultice. The root of the
common carrot may be grated, and moistened with
as much water as will bring it to the consistence of
a poultice or cataplasm. This must be applied to
the sore, and renewed twice a-day. It generally
cleans the sore, eases the pain, and takes away the
disagreeable smell, which are objects of no small
importance in such a dreadful disorder<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c010'><sup>[158]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wort, or an infusion of malt, has been recommended
not only as a proper drink, but as a powerful
medicine in this disease, It must be frequently
made fresh, and the patient may take it at pleasure.
Two, three, or even four English pints of it may
be drank every day for a considerable time. No
benefit can be expected from any medicine in this
disease, unless it be persisted in for a long time.
It is of too obstinate a nature to be soon removed;
and, when it admits of a cure at all, it must be
brought about by inducing an almost total change
of the habit, which must always be a work of time.
Setons or issues in the neighbourhood of the cancer
have sometimes good effects<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c010'><sup>[159]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_472'>472</span>When all other medicines fail, recourse must be
had to opium, as a kind of solace. This will not
indeed cure the disease, but it will ease the patient’s
agony, and render life more tolerable while
it continues.</p>

<p class='c008'>To avoid this dreadful disorder, people ought to
use wholesome food; to take sufficient exercise in
the open air; to be as easy and cheerful as possible;

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLVI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF POISONS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Every person ought, in some measure, to be
acquainted with the nature and cure of poisons.
They are generally taken unawares, and their effects
are often so sudden and violent, as not to admit
of delay, or allow time to procure the assistance
of physicians. Happily indeed no great degree of
medical knowledge is here necessary; the remedies
for most poisons being generally at hand, or easily
obtained, and nothing but common prudence
needful in the application of them.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_473'>473</span>The vulgar notion, that every poison is cured by
some counter-poison, as a specific, has done much
hurt. People believe they can do nothing for the
patient, unless they know the particular antidote to
that kind of poison which he has taken. Whereas
the cure of all poisons taken into the stomach,
without exception, depends chiefly on discharging
them as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is no case wherein the indications of cure
are more obvious. Poison is seldom long in the
stomach before it occasions sickness, with an inclination
to vomit. This shews plainly what ought to
be done. Indeed common sense dictates to every
one, that, if any thing has been taken into the
stomach which endangers life, it ought immediately
to be discharged. Were this duly regarded, the
danger arising from poisons might generally be
avoided. The method of prevention is obvious,
and the means are in the hands of every one.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall not take up the reader’s time with a
detail of the ridiculous notions which have prevailed
among ignorant people in different ages with regard
to poisons; neither shall we mention the
boasted antidotes, which have been recommended
either for preventing or obviating their effects; but
shall content ourselves with pointing out the poisons
most common in this country, and the means
of avoiding their dangerous consequences.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poisons either belong to the mineral, the vegetable,
or the animal kingdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mineral poisons are commonly of an acrid or
corrosive quality; as arsenic, cobalt, the corrosive
sublimate of mercury, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those of the vegetable kind are generally of a
narcotic or stupefactive quality; as poppy, hemlock,
henbane, berries of the deadly night-shade,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_474'>474</span>Poisonous animals communicate their infection
either by the bite or sting. This poison is very
different from the former, and only produces its
effects when received into the body by a wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>MINERAL POISONS.——Arsenic is the most
common of this class; and, as the whole of them
are pretty similar both in their effects and method
of cure, what is said with respect to it will be
applicable to every other species of corrosive
poison.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a person has taken arsenic, he soon perceives
a burning heat, and a violent pricking pain
in his stomach and bowels, with an intolerable
thirst, and an inclination to vomit. The tongue
and throat feel rough and dry; and, if proper
means be not soon administered, the patient is
seized with great anxiety, hiccuping, faintings, and
coldness of the extremities. To these succeed black
vomits, fœtid stools, with a mortification of the
stomach and intestines, which are the immediate
forerunners of death.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first appearance of these symptoms the
patient should drink large quantities of new milk
and sallad oil till he vomits; or he may drink
warm water mixed with oil. Fat broths are likewise
proper, provided they can be got ready in
time. Where no oil is to be had, fresh butter may
be melted and mixed with the milk or water.
These things are to be drank as long as the inclination
to vomit continues. Some have drank eight
or ten English quarts before the vomiting ceased;
and it is never safe to leave off drinking while one
particle of the poison remains in the stomach.</p>

<p class='c008'>These oily or fat substances not only provoke
vomiting, but likewise blunt the acrimony of the
poison, and prevent its wounding the bowels; but
if they should not make the person vomit, half a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_475'>475</span>drachm or two scruples of the powder of ipecacuanha
must be given, or a few spoonfuls of the oxymel
or vinegar of squills may be mixed with the
water which he drinks. Vomiting may likewise be
excited by tickling the inside of the throat with a
feather. Should these methods however fail, half
a drachm of white vitriol, or five or six grains of
emetic tartar, must be administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>If tormenting pains are felt in the lower belly,
and there is reason to fear that the poison has got
down to the intestines, clysters of milk and oil must
be very frequently thrown up; and the patient must
drink emollient decoctions of barley, oatmeal,
marsh-mallows, and such like. He must likewise
take an infusion of senna and manna, a solution of
Glauber’s salts, or some other purgative.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the poison has been evacuated, the patient
ought, for some time, to live upon such things as
are of a healing and cooling quality; to abstain
from flesh and all strong liquors, and to live upon
milk, broth, gruel, light puddings, and other
spoon meats of easy digestion. His drink should
be barley-water, linseed-tea, or infusions of any of
the mild mucilaginous vegetables.</p>

<p class='c008'>VEGETABLE POISONS, besides heat and
pain of the stomach, commonly occasion some degree
of giddiness, and often a kind of stupidity or
folly. Persons who have taken these poisons must
be treated in the same manner as for the mineral or
corrosive.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the vegetable poisons, when allowed to
remain in the stomach, often prove fatal; yet the
danger is generally over as soon as they are discharged.
Not being of such a caustic or corrosive
nature, they are less apt to wound or inflame the
bowels than mineral substances: no time, however,
ought to be lost in having them discharged.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_476'>476</span>Opium, being frequently taken by mistake, merits
particular attention. It is used as a medicine
both in a solid and liquid form, which latter commonly
goes by the name of laudanum. It is indeed
a valuable medicine when taken in proper
quantity; but as an over-dose proves a strong poison,
we shall point out its common effects, together
with the method of cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>An over-dose of opium generally occasions great
drowsiness, with stupor and other apoplectic symptoms.
Sometimes the person has so great an inclination
to sleep, that it is almost impossible to keep
him awake. Every method must however be tried
for this purpose. He should be tossed, shaked, and
moved about. Sharp blistering-plasters should be
applied to his legs or arms, and stimulating medicines,
as salts of hartshorn, &#38;c. held under his
nose. It will also be proper to let blood. At the
same time every method must be taken to make
him discharge the poison. This may be done in
the manner directed above, <i>viz.</i> by the use of
strong vomits, drinking plenty of warm water with
oil, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mead, besides vomits, in this case, recommends
acid medicines with lixivial salts. He says, that he
has often given salt of wormwood mixed with juice
of lemon in repeated doses with great success.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the body should remain weak and languid after
the poison has been discharged, nourishing diet
and cordials will be proper; but when there is
reason to fear that the stomach or bowels are inflamed,
the greatest circumspection is necessary both
with regard to food and medicine.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_477'>477</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF THE BITES OF POISONOUS ANIMALS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We shall begin with the bite of a mad dog, as it
is both the most common and dangerous animal-poison
in this country.</p>

<p class='c008'>The creatures naturally liable to contract this disease
are, as far as we yet know, all of the dog kind,
<i>viz.</i> foxes, dogs, and wolves. Hence it is called
the <i>rabies canina</i>, or dog madness. Of the last we
have none in this island; and it so seldom happens
that any person is bit by the first, that they scarce
deserve to be taken notice of. If such a thing
should happen, the method of treatment is precisely
the same as for the bite of a mad dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>The symptoms of madness in a dog are as follow:
At first he looks dull, shews an aversion to
food and company: he does not bark as usual, but
seems to murmur, is peevish, and apt to bite strangers:
his ears and tail droop more than usual, and
he appears drowsy: afterwards he begins to loll out
his tongue, and froth at the mouth, his eyes seeming
heavy and watery: he now, if not confined,
takes off, runs panting along with a kind of dejected
air, and endeavours to bite every one he meets.
Other dogs are said to fly from him. Some think
this a certain sign of madness, supposing that
they know him by the smell; but it is not to be depended
on. If he escapes being killed, he seldom
runs above two or three days, till he dies exhausted
with heat, hunger, and fatigue.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease is most frequent after long, dry, hot
seasons; and such dogs as live upon putrid stinking
carrion, without having enough of fresh water, are
most liable to it.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_478'>478</span>When any person has been bit by a dog, the
strictest inquiry ought to be made whether the animal
was really mad. Many disagreeable consequences
arise from neglecting to ascertain this point.
Some people have lived in continual anxiety for
many years, because they had been bit by a dog
which they believed to be mad; but, as he had
been killed on the spot, it was impossible to ascertain
the fact. This should induce us, instead of
killing a dog the moment he has bit any person, to
do all in our power to keep him alive, at least till
we can be certain whether he be mad or not.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many circumstances may contribute to make
people imagine a dog mad. He loses his master,
runs about in quest of him, is set upon by other
dogs, and perhaps by men. The creature, thus
frightened, beat, and abused, looks wild, and lolls
out his tongue as he runs along. Immediately a
crowd is after him; while he, finding himself
closely pursued, and taking every one he meets for
an enemy, naturally attempts to bite him in self-defence.
He soon gets knocked on the head, and
it passes currently that he was mad, as it is then
impossible to prove the contrary.</p>

<p class='c008'>This being the true history of, by far, the greater
part of those dogs which pass for mad, is it any
wonder that numberless whimsical medicines have
been extolled for preventing the effects of their
bite? This readily accounts for the great variety of
infallible remedies for the bite of a mad dog, which
are to be met with in almost every family. Though
not one in a thousand has any claim to merit, yet
they are all supported by numberless vouchers.
No wonder that imaginary diseases should be cured
by imaginary remedies. In this way, credulous
people first impose upon themselves, and then deceive
others. The same medicine which was supposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_479'>479</span>to prevent the effects of the bite, when the
dog was not mad, is recommended to a person
who has had the misfortune to be bit by a dog that
was really mad. He takes it, trusts to it, and is
undone.</p>

<p class='c008'>To these mistakes we must impute the frequent
ill success of the medicines used for preventing the
effects of the bite of a mad dog. It is not owing
so much to a defect in medicine, as to wrong applications.
I am persuaded, if proper medicines
were administered immediately after the bite is received,
and continued for a sufficient length of
time, we should not lose one in a thousand of
those who have the misfortune to be bit by a mad
dog.</p>

<p class='c008'>This poison is generally communicated by a
wound, which nevertheless heals as soon as a common
wound: but afterwards it begins to feel painful,
and as the pain spreads towards the neighbouring
parts, the person becomes heavy and listless.
His sleep is unquiet with frightful dreams;
he sighs, looks dull, and loves solitude. These
are the forerunners, or rather the first symptoms of
that dreadful disease occasioned by the bite of a
mad dog. But as we do not propose to treat fully
of the disease itself, but to point out the method
of preventing it, we shall not take up time in
shewing its progress from the first invasion to its
commonly fatal end.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common notion, that this poison may lie in
the body for many years, and afterwards prove fatal,
is both hurtful and ridiculous. It must render
such persons as have had the misfortune to be
bit very unhappy, and can have no good effects.
If the person takes proper medicines for forty days
after the time of his being bit, and feels no symptoms
of the disease, there is reason to believe him
out of danger.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_480'>480</span>The medicines recommended for preventing the
effects of the bite of a mad dog, are chiefly such
as promote the different secretions, and antispasmodics.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Mead recommends a preventive medicine,
which he says he never knew fail, though in the
space of thirty years he had used it a thousand
times.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor’s prescription is as follows:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take ash-coloured ground liver-wort, cleaned,
dried, and powdered, half an ounce; of black
pepper powdered, a quarter of an ounce. Mix
these well together, and divide the powder into
four doses; one of which must be taken every
morning fasting, for four mornings successively, in
half an English pint of cows milk warm.</p>

<p class='c008'>“After these four doses are taken, the patient
must go into the cold bath, or a cold spring or
river, every morning fasting, for a month; he must
be dipped all over, but not stay in (with his head
above water) longer than half a minute, if the water
be very cold. After this he must go in three
times a-week for a fortnight longer.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The person must be bled before he begins to
use the medicine<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c010'><sup>[161]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall next mention the famous East India
specific, as it is called. This medicine is composed
of cinnabar and musk. It is esteemed a great antispasmodic;
and, by many, extolled as an infallible
remedy for preventing the effects of the bite
of a mad dog.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_481'>481</span>“Take native and factitious cinnabar, of each
twenty-four grains, musk sixteen grains. Let these
be made into a fine powder, and taken in a glass of
arrack or brandy.”</p>

<p class='c008'>This single dose is said to secure the person for
thirty days, at the end of which it must be repeated;
but if he has any symptoms of the disease, it must
be repeated in three hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following is likewise reckoned a good antispasmodic
medicine:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take of Virginian snake-root in powder, half
a drachm, gum asafœtida twelve grains, gum camphire
seven grains; make these into a bolus with a
little syrup of saffron.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Camphire may also be given in the following
manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Take purified nitre half an ounce, Virginian
snake-root in powder two drachms, camphire one
drachm; rub them together in a mortar, and divide
the whole into ten doses.”</p>

<p class='c008'>Mercury is likewise recommended as of great
efficacy, both in the prevention and cure of this
kind of madness. When used as a preventive, it
will be sufficient to rub daily a drachm of the ointment
into the parts about the wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vinegar is likewise of considerable service, and
should be taken freely, either in the patient’s food
or drink.</p>

<p class='c008'>These are the principal medicines recommended
for preventing the effects of the bite of a mad dog.
We would not however advise people to trust to
any one of them; but from a proper combination
of their different powers, there is the greatest reason
to hope for success.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great error in the use of these medicines
lies in not taking them for a sufficient length of
time. They are used more like charms, than medicines
intended to produce any change in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_482'>482</span>body. To this, and not to the insufficiency of the
medicines, we must impute their frequent want of
success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Mead says, that the virtue of his medicine
consists in promoting urine. But how a poison
should be expelled by urine, with only three or
four doses of any medicine, however powerful, it is
not easy to conceive. More time is certainly necessary,
even though the medicine were more
powerful than that which the Doctor prescribes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The East India specific is still more exceptionable
on this account.</p>

<p class='c008'>As these and most other medicines, taken singly,
have frequently been found to fail, we shall recommend
the following course:</p>

<p class='c008'>If a person be bit in a fleshy part, where there is
no hazard of hurting any large blood-vessel, the
parts adjacent to the wound may be cut away. But
if this be not done soon after the bite has been received,
it will be better to omit it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The wound may be dressed with salt and water,
or a pickle made of vinegar and salt, and afterwards
dressed twice a-day with yellow basilicon
mixed with red precipitate of mercury.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should begin to use either Dr. Mead’s
medicine, or some of the others mentioned above.
If he takes Mead’s medicine, he may use it as the
Doctor directs for four days successively. Let him
then omit it for two or three days, and again repeat
the same number of doses as before.</p>

<p class='c008'>During this course, he must rub into the parts
about the wound, daily, one drachm of the mercurial
ointment. This may be done for ten or
twelve days at least.</p>

<p class='c008'>When this course is over, he may take a purge
or two, and wait a few days till the effect of the
mercury be gone off. He must then begin to use
the cold bath, into which he may go every morning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_483'>483</span>for five or six weeks. If he should feel cold
and chilly for a long time after coming out of the
cold bath, it will be better to use a tepid one, or
to have the water a little warmed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the mean time, we would advise him not to
leave off all internal medicines, but to take either
one of the boluses of snake-root, asafœtida, and
camphire; or one of the powders of nitre, camphire,
and snake-root, twice a-day. These may be
used during the whole time he is bathing.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the use of the mercurial ointment, the
patient must keep within doors, and take nothing
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proper regimen must be observed throughout
the whole course. The patient should abstain from
flesh, and all salted and high-seasoned provisions.
He must avoid strong liquors, and live mostly upon
a light and rather spare diet. His mind should be
kept as easy and cheerful as possible, and all excessive
heat and violent passions avoided with the
utmost care.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have never seen this course of medicine, with
proper regimen, fail to prevent the hydrophobia,
and cannot help again observing, that the want of
success must generally be owing either to the application
of improper medicines, or not using proper
ones for a sufficient length of time.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mankind are extremely fond of every thing that
promises a sudden or miraculous cure. By trusting
to these they often lose their lives, when a regular
course of medicine would have rendered
them absolutely safe. This holds remarkably in
the present case. Numbers of people, for example,
believe if they or their cattle were once dipped in the
sea, it is sufficient; as if the salt-water were a charm
against the effects of the bite. This, and such like
whims, have proved fatal to many.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_484'>484</span>It is a common notion, if a person be bit by a
dog which is not mad, that, if he should go mad
afterwards, the person would be affected with the
disorder at the same time; but this notion is too ridiculous
to deserve a serious consideration. It is a
good rule, however, to avoid dogs as much as
possible, as the disease is often upon them for some
time before its violent symptoms appear. The hydrophobia
has been occasioned by the bite of a dog
which shewed no other symptoms of the disease but
listlessness and a sullen disposition.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though we do not mean to treat fully of the cure
of the hydrophobia, yet we are far from reckoning
it incurable. The notion that this disease could not
be cured, has been productive of the most horrid
consequences. It was usual either to abandon the
unhappy persons, as soon as they were seized with
the disease, to their fate, to bleed them to death, or
to suffocate them between matrasses or feather-beds,
&#38;c. This conduct certainly deserved the severest
punishment! We hope, for the honour of human
nature, it will never again be heard of.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have never had an opportunity of treating
this disease, and therefore can say nothing of it from
my own experience; but the learned Dr. Tissot says,
it may be cured in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>1. The patient must be bled to a considerable
quantity; and this may be repeated twice, or
thrice, or even a fourth time, if circumstances
require it.</p>

<p class='c008'>2. The patient should be put, if possible, into
a warm bath; and this should be used twice a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>3. He should every day receive two, or even three
emollient clysters.</p>

<p class='c008'>4. The wound, and the parts adjoining to it,
should be rubbed with the mercurial ointment twice
a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_485'>485</span>5. The whole limb which contains the wound
should be rubbed with oil, and be wrapped up in
an oily flannel.</p>

<p class='c008'>6. Every three hours a dose of Cob’s powder
should be taken in a cup of the infusion of lime-tree
and elder-flowers. This powder is made, by
rubbing together in a mortar, to a very fine powder,
of native and factitious cinnabar, each twenty-four
grains; of musk, sixteen grains<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c010'><sup>[162]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>7. The following bolus is to be given every
night, and to be repeated in the morning, if the
patient is not easy, washing it down with the infusion
mentioned above: Take one drachm of Virginian
snake-root in powder; of camphire and asafœtida,
ten grains each; of opium, one grain;
and, with a sufficient quantity of conserve, or rob
of elder, make a bolus.</p>

<p class='c008'>8. If there be a great nausea at the stomach,
with a bitterness in the mouth, thirty-five or forty
grains of ipecacuanha, in powder, may be taken
for a vomit.</p>

<p class='c008'>9. The patient’s food, if he takes any, must be
light; as panado, soups made of farinaceous or
mealy vegetables, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>10. If the patient should long continue weak,
and subject to terrors, he may take half a drachm
of the Peruvian bark thrice a-day.</p>

<p class='c020'>The next poisonous animal which we shall mention
is the VIPER. The grease of this animal
rubbed into the wound is said to cure the bite.
Though that is all the viper-catchers generally do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_486'>486</span>when bit, we should not think it sufficient for the
bite of an enraged viper. It would surely be more
safe to have the wound well sucked<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c010'><sup>[163]</sup></a>, and afterwards
rubbed with warm salad-oil. A poultice of
bread and milk, softened with salad-oil, should
likewise be applied to the wound; and the patient
ought to drink freely of vinegar whey, or water-gruel
with vinegar in it, to make him sweat. Vinegar
is one of the best medicines which can be used
in any kind of poison, and ought to be taken very
liberally. If the patient be sick, he may take
a vomit. This course will be sufficient to cure
the bite of any of the poisonous animals of this
country.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to poisonous insects, as the bee, the
wasp, the hornet, &#38;c. their stings are seldom attended
with danger, unless when a person happens
to be stung by a great number of them at the same
time; in which case something should be done to
abate the inflammation and swelling. Some, for
this purpose, apply honey, others lay pounded
parsley to the part. A mixture of vinegar and
Venice treacle is likewise recommended; but I
have always found rubbing the part with warm salad-oil
succeed very well. Indeed, when the stings
are so numerous as to endanger the patient’s life,
which is sometimes the case, he must not only have
oily poultices applied to the part, but should likewise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_487'>487</span>be bled, and take some cooling medicines, as
nitre, or cream of tartar, and should drink plentifully
of diluting liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is the happiness of this island to have very few
poisonous animals, and those which we have are by
no means of the most virulent kind. Nine-tenths
of the effects attributed to poison or venom in this
country, are really other diseases, and proceed from
quite different causes.</p>

<p class='c008'>We cannot however make the same observation
with regard to poisonous vegetables. These abound
every where, and prove often fatal to the ignorant
and unwary. This indeed is chiefly owing to carelessness.
Children ought early to be cautioned
against eating any kind of fruit, roots, or berries,
which they do not know, and all poisonous plants
to which they can have access, ought, as far as
possible, to be destroyed. This would not be so
difficult a task as some people imagine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Poisonous plants have no doubt their use, and
they ought to be propagated in proper places; but,
as they prove often destructive to cattle, they should
be rooted out of all pasture-grounds. They ought
likewise, for the safety of the human species, to be
destroyed in the neighbourhood of all towns and
villages; which, by the bye, are the places where
they most commonly abound. I have seen the poisonous
hemlock, henbane, wolfsbane, and deadly
night-shade, all growing within the <i>environs</i> of a
small town, where, though several persons, within
the memory of those living in it, had lost their
lives by one or other of these plants; yet no method,
that I could hear of, had ever been taken to
root them out; though this might be done at a
very trifling expence.</p>

<p class='c008'>Seldom a year passes but we have accounts of several
persons poisoned by eating hemlock-roots
<span class='pageno' id='Page_488'>488</span>instead of parsnips, or some kinds of fungus which
they had gathered for mushrooms. These examples
ought to put people upon their guard with respect
to the former, and to put the latter entirely out of
use. Mushrooms may be a delicate dish, but they
are a dangerous one, as they are generally gathered
by persons who do not know one kind of fungus
from another, and take every thing for a mushroom
which has that appearance.</p>

<p class='c008'>We might here mention many other plants and
animals of a poisonous nature which are found in
foreign countries; but, as our observations are
chiefly intended for this island, we shall pass these
over. It may not however be amiss to observe,
for the benefit of such of our countrymen as go to
America, that an effectual remedy is now said to be
found for the bite of the rattle-snake.—The prescription
is as follows: Take of the roots of plantain
and horehound, in summer, roots and branches
together, a sufficient quantity; bruise them in a
mortar, and squeeze out the juice, of which give,
as soon as possible, one large spoonful; if the patient
be swelled, you must force it down his throat.
This generally will cure; but, if he finds no relief
in an hour after, you may give another spoonful,
which never fails.—If the roots are dried, they
must be moistened with a little water. To the
wound may be applied a leaf of good tobacco
moistened with rum.</p>

<p class='c008'>We give this upon the faith of Dr. Brookes,
who says it was the invention of a negro; for the
discovery of which he had his freedom purchased,
and a hundred pounds <i>per annum</i> settled upon him
during life, by the General Assembly of Carolina.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is possible there may be in nature specific remedies
for every kind of poison; but as we have very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_489'>489</span>little faith in any of those which have yet been pretended
to be discovered, we shall beg leave again
to recommend the most strict attention to the following
rules, <i>viz.</i> That when any poisonous substance
has been taken into the stomach, it ought, as
soon as possible, to be discharged by vomits, clysters,
and purges; and, when poison has been received
into the body by a wound, that it be expelled
by medicines which promote the different
secretions, especially those of sweat, urine, and insensible
perspiration; to which may be joined antispasmodics,
or such medicines as take off tension
and irritation; the chief of which are opium, musk,
camphire, and asafœtida.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLVII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF THE VENEREAL DISEASE.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>In the first edition of this book the venereal disease
was omitted. The reasons however which
at that time induced me to leave it out, have upon
more mature consideration vanished. Bad consequences,
no doubt, may arise from ignorant persons
tampering with medicine in this disorder; but
the danger from that quarter seems to be more than
balanced by the great and solid advantages, which
must arise to the patient from an early knowledge
of his case, and an attention to a plan of regimen,
which, if it does not cure the disease, will be sure
to render it more mild, and less hurtful to the constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is peculiarly unfortunate for the unhappy persons
who contract this disease, that it lies under a
sort of disgrace. This renders disguise necessary,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_490'>490</span>and makes the patient either conceal his disorder
altogether, or apply to those who promise a sudden
and secret cure; but who in fact only remove the
symptoms for a time, while they fix the disease
deeper in the habit. By this means a slight infection,
which might have been easily removed, is
often converted into an obstinate, and sometimes
incurable malady.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another unfavourable circumstance attending
this disease is, that it assumes a variety of different
shapes, and may with more propriety be called an
assemblage of diseases, than a single one. No two
diseases can require a more different method of
treatment than this does in its different stages.
Hence the folly and danger of trusting to any particular
nostrum for the cure of it. Such nostrums
are however generally administered in the same manner
to all who apply for them, without the least
regard to the state of the disease, the constitution
of the patient, the degree of infection, and a thousand
other circumstances of the utmost importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though the venereal disease is generally the fruit
of unlawful embraces, yet it may be communicated
to the innocent as well as the guilty. Infants,
nurses, midwives, and married women whose husbands
lead dissolute lives, are often affected with
it, and frequently lose their lives by not being
aware of their danger in due time. The unhappy
condition of such persons will certainly plead our
excuse, if any excuse be necessary, for endeavouring
to point out the symptoms and cure of this too
common disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>To enumerate all its different symptoms, however,
and to trace the disease minutely through its
various stages, would require a much larger space
than falls to this part of my subject; I shall therefore
confine my observations chiefly to circumstances
<span class='pageno' id='Page_491'>491</span>of importance, omitting such as are either
trifling, or which occur but seldom. I shall likewise
pass over the history of the disease, with the
different methods of treatment which it has undergone
since it was first introduced into Europe, and
many other circumstances of a similar nature; all
of which, though they might tend to amuse the
reader, yet could afford him little or no useful
knowledge.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE VIRULENT GONORRHŒA.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The virulent gonorrhœa is an involuntary discharge
of infectious matter from the parts of generation
in either sex. It generally makes its appearance
within eight or ten days after the infection
has been received: sometimes indeed it appears
in two or three days, and at other times not
before the end of four or five weeks. Previous to
the discharge, the patient feels an itching with a
small degree of pain in the genitals. Afterwards
a thin glary matter begins to distil from the urinary
passage, which stains the linen, and occasions
a small degree of titillation, particularly in the
time of making water; this gradually increasing,
arises at length to a degree of heat and pain, which
are chiefly perceived about the extremity of the
urinary passage, where a slight degree of redness
and inflammation likewise begin to appear.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the disorder advances, the pain, heat of
urine, and running, increase, while fresh symptoms
daily ensue. In men the erections become
painful and involuntary, and are more frequent
and lasting than when natural. This symptom is
most troublesome when the patient is warm in
bed. The pain which was at first only perceived
towards the extremity, now begins to reach all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_492'>492</span>up the urinary passage, and is most intense just
after the patient has done making water. The running
gradually recedes from the colour of seed,
grows yellow, and at length puts on the appearance
of matter.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the disorder has arrived at its height, all
the symptoms are more intense; the heat of urine
is so great, that the patient dreads the making water;
and though he feels a constant inclination this
way, yet it is rendered with the greatest difficulty,
and often only by drops: the involuntary erections
now become extremely painful and frequent; there
is also a pain, heat, and sense of fulness about the
seat, and the running is plentiful and sharp, of a
brown, greenish, and sometimes of a bloody colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>By a proper treatment the violence of the symptoms
gradually abates; the heat of urine goes off;
the involuntary and painful erections, and the heat
and pain about the seat, become easier; the running
also gradually decreases, grows whiter and
thicker, till at last it entirely disappears.</p>

<p class='c008'>By attending to these symptoms, the gonorrhœa
may be generally distinguished from any other disease.
There are however some few disorders for
which it may be mistaken, as an ulcer in the kidnies
or bladder, the <i>fluor albus</i> or whites in women,
&#38;c. But in the former of these, the matter comes
away only with the urine, or when the sphincter of
the bladder is open; whereas in a gonorrhœa, the
discharge is constant. The latter is more difficult
to distinguish, and must be known chiefly from
its effects, as pain, communicating the infection,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——When a person has reason to
suspect that he has caught the venereal infection, he
ought most strictly to observe a cooling regimen,
to avoid every thing of a heating nature, as wines,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_493'>493</span>spirituous liquors, rich sauces, spiced, salted, high-seasoned
and smoke-dried provisions, &#38;c. as also
all aromatic and stimulating vegetables, as onions,
garlic, shallot, nutmeg, mustard, cinnamon, mace,
ginger, and such like. His food ought chiefly to
consist of mild vegetables, milk, broths, light
puddings, panado, gruels, &#38;c. His drink may
be barley-water, milk and water, decoctions of
marsh-mallows and liquorice, linseed-tea, or clear
whey. Of these he ought to drink plentifully.
Violent exercise of all kinds, especially riding on
horseback, and venereal pleasures, are to be avoided.
The patient must beware of cold, and when
the inflammation is violent, he ought to keep his
bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——A virulent gonorrhœa cannot
always be cured speedily and effectually at the same
time. The patient ought therefore not to expect,
nor the physician to promise it. It will often continue
for two or three weeks, and sometimes for
five or six, even where the treatment has been very
proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes indeed a slight infection may be carried
off in a few days, by bathing the parts in warm
milk and water, and injecting frequently up the
urethra a little sweet oil or linseed-tea about the
warmth of new milk. Should these not succeed in
carrying off the infection, they will at least have a
tendency to lessen its virulence.</p>

<p class='c008'>To effect a cure, however, astringent injections
will generally be found necessary. These may be
various ways prepared, but I think those made
with the white vitriol are both most safe and efficacious.
They can be made stronger or weaker as
circumstances may require; but it is best to begin
with the more gentle, and increase their power if
necessary.  I generally order a drachm of white
vitriol to be dissolved in eight or nine ounces of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_494'>494</span>common or rose-water, and an ordinary syringe full
of it to be thrown up three or four times a-day.
If this quantity does not perform a cure, it may
be repeated, and the dose increased<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c010'><sup>[164]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whether injections be used or not, cooling
purges are always proper in the gonorrhœa. They
ought not however to be of the strong or drastic
kind. Whatever raises a violent commotion in the
body increases the danger, and tends to drive the
disease deeper into the habit. Procuring two or
three stools every second or third day for the first
fortnight, and the same number every fourth or
fifth day for the second, will generally be sufficient
to remove the inflammatory symptoms, to diminish
the running, and to change its colour and consistence.
It gradually becomes more white and ropy
as the virulence abates<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c010'><sup>[165]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_495'>495</span>When the inflammatory symptoms run high,
bleeding is always necessary at the beginning. This
operation, as in other topical inflammations, must
be repeated according to the strength and constitution
of the patient, and the vehemence and urgency
of the symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>Medicines which promote the secretion of urine,
are likewise proper in this stage of the disorder.
For this purpose, an ounce of nitre and two ounces
of gum-arabic, pounded together, may be divided
into twenty-four doses, one of which may be taken
frequently in a cup of the patient’s drink. If these
should make him pass his urine so often as to become
troublesome to him, he may either take them
less frequently, or leave out the nitre altogether,
and take equal parts of gum-arabic and cream of
tartar. These may be pounded together, and a
tea-spoonful taken in a cup of the patient’s drink
four or five times a-day. I have generally found
this answer extremely well both as a diuretic, and
for keeping the body gently open.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the pain and inflammation are seated high
towards the neck of the bladder, it will be proper
frequently to throw up an emollient clyster, which,
besides the benefit of procuring stools, will serve as
a fomentation to the inflamed parts.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_496'>496</span>Soft poultices, when they can conveniently be
applied to the parts, are of great service. They
may be made of the flour of linseed, or of wheat-bread
and milk, softened with fresh butter or sweet
oil. When poultices cannot be conveniently used,
cloths wrung out of warm water, or bladders filled
with warm milk and water, may be applied. I
have often known the most excruciating pains, during
the inflammatory state of the gonorrhœa, relieved
by one or other of these applications.</p>

<p class='c008'>Few things tend more to keep off inflammation
in the spermatic vessels, than a proper truss for the
scrotum. It ought to be so contrived as to support
the testicles, and should be worn from the first
appearance of the disease till it has ceased some
weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above treatment will sometimes remove the
gonorrhœa so quickly, that the person will be in
doubt whether he really laboured under that disease.
This, however, is too favourable a turn to be
often expected. It more frequently happens, that
we are able only to procure an abatement or remission
of the inflammatory symptoms, so far as to
make it safe to have recourse to the great antidote
<i>mercury</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people, on the first appearance of a gonorrhœa,
fly to the use of mercury. This is a bad
plan. Mercury is often not at all necessary in a
gonorrhœa; and when taken too early, it does mischief.
It may be necessary to complete the cure,
but can never be proper at the commencement of
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When bleeding, purging, fomentations, and the
other things recommended above, have eased the
pain, softened the pulse, relieved the heat of urine,
and rendered the involuntary erections less frequent,
the patient may begin to use mercury in any form
that is least disagreeable to him.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_497'>497</span>If he takes the common mercurial pill, two at
night and one in the morning will be a sufficient
dose at first. Should they affect the mouth too
much, the dose must be lessened; if not at all, it
may be gradually increased to five or six pills in the
day. If calomel be thought preferable, two or
three grains of it, formed into a bolus with a little
of the conserve of hips, may be taken at bed-time,
and the dose gradually increased to eight or ten
grains. One of the most common preparations
of mercury now in use is the corrosive sublimate.
This may be taken in the manner afterwards recommended
under the confirmed lues or pox. I
have always found it one of the most safe and efficacious
medicines when properly used.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above medicines may either be taken every
day or every other day, as the patient is able to
bear them. They ought never to be taken in such
quantity as to raise a salivation, unless in a very
slight degree. The disease may be more safely, and
as certainly, cured without a salivation as with it.
When the mercury runs off by the mouth, it is not
so successful in carrying off the disease, as when it
continues longer in the body, and is discharged
gradually.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should the patient be purged or griped in the
night by the mercury, he must take an infusion of
senna, or some other purgative, and drink freely of
water-gruel to prevent bloody stools, which are very
apt to happen should the patient catch cold, or
if the mercury has not been duly prepared. When
the bowels are weak and the mercury is apt to
gripe or purge, these disagreeable consequences
may be prevented by taking, with the above pills
or bolus, half a drachm or two scruples of diascordium,
or of the Japonic confection.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent the disagreeable circumstance of the
mercury’s affecting the mouth too much, or bringing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_498'>498</span>on a salivation, it may be combined with purgatives.
With this view the laxative mercurial
pill has been contrived, the usual dose of which is
half a drachm, or three pills, night and morning,
to be repeated every other day; but the safer way
is for the patient to begin with two, or even with
one pill, gradually increasing the dose.</p>

<p class='c008'>To such persons as can neither swallow a bolus
nor a pill, mercury may be given in a liquid form,
as it can be suspended even in a watery vehicle, by
means of gum-arabic; which not only serves this
purpose, but likewise prevents the mercury from
affecting the mouth, and renders it in many respects
a better medicine<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c010'><sup>[166]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It happens very fortunately for those who cannot
be brought to take mercury inwardly, and likewise
for persons whose bowels are too tender to bear it,
that an external application of it will answer equally
well, and in some respects better. It must be acknowledged,
that mercury, taken inwardly for any
length of time, greatly weakens and disorders the
bowels; for which reason, when a plentiful use of
it becomes necessary, we would prefer rubbing to
the mercurial pills. The common mercurial or
blue ointment will answer very well. Of that
which is made by rubbing together equal quantities
of hog’s lard and quicksilver, about a drachm
may be used at a time. The best time for rubbing
it on is at night, and the most proper place
<span class='pageno' id='Page_499'>499</span>the inner side of the thighs. The patient should
stand before the fire when he rubs, and should wear
flannel drawers next his skin at the time he is using
the ointment. If ointment of a weaker or stronger
kind be used, the quantity must be increased or diminished
in proportion.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, during the use of the ointment, the inflammation
of the genital parts, together with the heat
and feverishness, should return, or if the mouth
should grow sore, the gums tender, and the breath
become offensive, a dose or two of Glauber’s salts,
or some other cooling purge, may be taken, and
the rubbing intermitted for a few days. As soon,
however, as the signs of spitting are gone off, if
the virulency be not quite corrected, the ointment
must be repeated, but in smaller quantities, and at
longer intervals than before. Whatever way mercury
is administered, its use must be persisted in
as long as any virulency is suspected to remain.</p>

<p class='c008'>During this, which may be called the second
stage of the disorder, though so strict a regimen
is not necessary as in the first or inflammatory
state, yet intemperance of every kind must be
avoided. The food must be light, plain, and of
easy digestion; and the greatest indulgence that
may be allowed with respect to drink is, a little
wine diluted with a sufficient quantity of water.
Spirituous liquors are to be avoided in every shape.
I have often known the inflammatory symptoms renewed
and heightened, the running increased, and
the cure rendered extremely difficult and tedious,
by one fit of excessive drinking.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the above treatment has removed the
heat of urine, and soreness of the genital parts;
when the quantity of running is considerably lessened,
without any pain or swelling in the groin or
testicle supervening; when the patient is free from
involuntary erections; and lastly, when the running
<span class='pageno' id='Page_500'>500</span>becomes pale, whitish, thick, void of ill
smell, and tenacious or ropy; when all or most of
these symptoms appear, the gonorrhœa is arrived
at its last stage, and we may gradually proceed to
treat it as a gleet with astringent and agglutinating
medicines.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF GLEETS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A gonorrhœa frequently repeated, or improperly
treated, often ends in a gleet, which may
either proceed from relaxation, or from some remains
of the disease. It is however of the greatest
importance in the cure of the gleet, to know from
which of these causes it proceeds. When the discharge
proves very obstinate, and receives little or
no check from astringent remedies, there is ground
to suspect that it is owing to the latter; but if the
drain is inconstant, and is chiefly observable when
the patient is stimulated by lascivious ideas, or
upon straining to go to stool, we may reasonably
conclude that it is chiefly owing to the former.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the cure of a gleet proceeding from relaxation,
the principal design is to brace, and restore
a proper degree of tension to the debilitated and
relaxed vessels. For this purpose, besides the medicines
recommended in the gonorrhœa, the patient
may have recourse to stronger and more powerful
astringents, as the Peruvian bark<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c010'><sup>[167]</sup></a>, alum, vitriol,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_501'>501</span>galls, tormentil, bistort, baldustines, tincture
of gum kino, &#38;c. The injections may be rendered
more astringent by the addition of a few
grains of alum, or increasing the quantity of vitriol
as far as the parts are able to bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last remedy which we shall mention in this
case is the cold bath, than which there is not perhaps
a more powerful bracer in the whole compass
of medicine. It ought never to be omitted in this
species of gleet, unless there be something in the
constitution of the patient which renders the use of
it unsafe. The chief objections to the use of the
cold bath are, a full habit, and an unsound state
of the viscera. The danger from the former may
always be lessened, if not removed, by purging
and bleeding; but the latter is an insurmountable
obstacle, as the pressure of the water, and the sudden
contraction of the external vessels, by throwing
the blood with too much force upon the internal
parts, are apt to occasion ruptures of the vessels,
or a flux of humours upon the diseased organs.
But where no objection of this kind prevails,
the patient ought to plunge over head in
water every morning fasting, for three or four weeks
together. He should not however stay long in the
water, and should take care to have his skin dried
as soon as he comes out.</p>

<p class='c008'>The regimen proper in this case is the same as
was mentioned in the last stage of the gonorrhœa:
the diet must be drying and astringent, and the
drink Spa, Pyrmont, or Bristol waters, with which
a little claret or red wine may sometimes be mixed.
Any person may now afford to drink these waters,
as they can be every where prepared at almost no
expence, by a mixture of common chalk and oil
of vitriol.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the gleet does not in the smallest degree
yield to these medicines, there is reason to suspect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_502'>502</span>that it proceeds from ulcers. In this case recourse
must be had to mercury, and such medicines as
tend to correct any predominant acrimony with
which the juices may be affected, as the decoction
of China, sarsaparilla, sassafras, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Fordyce says, he has seen many obstinate
gleets of two, three, or four years standing, effectually
cured by a mercurial inunction, when almost
every other medicine has been tried in vain. Dr.
Chapman seems to be of the same opinion; but
says, he has always found the mercury succeed best
in this case when joined with terebinthinate and
other agglutinating medicines. For which reason
the Doctor recommends pills made of calomel and
Venice turpentine<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c010'><sup>[168]</sup></a>; and desires that their use may
be accompanied with a decoction of guaiacum or
sarsaparilla.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last kind of remedy which we shall mention
for the cure of ulcers in the urinary passage, are
the suppurating candles or bougies: as these are
prepared various ways, and are generally to be
bought ready made, it is needless to spend time in
enumerating the different ingredients of which they
are composed, or teaching the manner of preparing
them. Before a bougie be introduced into the
urethra, however, it should be smeared all over
with sweet oil, to prevent it from stimulating too
suddenly; it may be suffered to continue in from
one to seven or eight hours, according as the patient
can bear it. Obstinate ulcers are not only
often healed, but tumours and excrescences in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_503'>503</span>urinary passages taken away, and an obstruction of
urine removed by means of bougies. Obstinate
gleets may be removed by the use of bougies.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE SWELLED TESTICLE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The swelled testicle may either proceed from
infection lately contracted, or from the venereal
poison lurking in the blood: the latter indeed is
not very common, but the former frequently happens
both in the first and second stages of a gonorrhœa;
particularly when the running is unseasonably
checked, by cold, hard drinking, strong drastic
purges, violent exercise, the too early use of
astringent medicines, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the inflammatory stage bleeding is necessary,
which must be repeated according to the urgency
of the symptoms<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c010'><sup>[169]</sup></a>. The food must be light, and
the drink diluting. High-seasoned food, flesh,
wines, and every thing of a heating nature, are to
be avoided. Fomentations are of singular service.
Poultices of bread and milk, softened with fresh
butter or oil, are likewise very proper, and ought
constantly to be applied when the patient is in bed:
when he is up, the testicles should be kept warm,
and supported by a bag or truss, which may easily
be contrived in such a manner as to prevent the
weight of the testicle from having any effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>If it should be found impracticable to clear the
testicle by the cooling regimen now pointed out,
and extended according to circumstances, it will be
necessary to lead the patient through such a complete
antivenereal course as shall ensure him against
any future uneasiness. For this purpose, besides
rubbing the mercurial ointment on the part, if free
<span class='pageno' id='Page_504'>504</span>from pain, or on the thighs, as directed in the gonorrhœa,
the patient must be confined to bed, if
necessary, for five or six weeks, suspending the testicle
all the while with a bag or truss, and plying
him inwardly with strong decoctions of sarsaparilla.</p>

<p class='c008'>When these means do not succeed, and there is
reason to suspect a scrophulous or cancerous habit,
either of which may support a scirrhous induration,
after the venereal poison is corrected, the parts
should be fomented daily with a decoction of hemlock,
the bruised leaves of which may likewise be
added to the poultice, and the extract at the same
time taken inwardly<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c010'><sup>[170]</sup></a>. This practice is strongly
recommended by Dr. Stork in scirrhous and cancerous
cases; and Mr. Fordyce assures us, that by
this method he has cured diseased testicles of two
or three years standing, even when ulcerated, and
when the scirrhus had begun to be affected with
pricking and lancing pains.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF BUBOES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Venereal buboes are hard tumours seated in the
groin, occasioned by the venereal poison lodged in
this part. They are of two kinds; <i>viz.</i> such as
proceed from a recent infection, and such as accompany
a confirmed lues.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cure of recent buboes, that is, such as appear
soon after impure coition, may be first attempted
by <i>dispersion</i>, and, if that should not succeed,
by <i>suppuration</i>. To promote the dispersion
of a bubo, the same regimen must be observed as
was directed in the first stage of a gonorrhœa. The
patient must likewise be bled, and take some cooling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_505'>505</span>purges, as the decoction of tamarinds and senna,
Glauber’s salts, and the like. If, by this course,
the swelling and other inflammatory symptoms
abate, we may safely proceed to the use of mercury,
which must be continued till the venereal virus
is quite subdued<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c010'><sup>[171]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>But if the bubo should, from the beginning, be
attended with great heat, pain, and pulsation, it
will be proper to promote its suppuration. For
this purpose the patient may be allowed to use his
ordinary diet, and to take now and then a glass of
wine. Emollient cataplasms, consisting of bread
and milk softened with oil or fresh butter, may be
applied to the part; and, in cold constitutions,
where the tumour advances slowly, white lily-roots
boiled, or sliced onions raw, and a sufficient quantity
of yellow basilicon, may be added to the poultice.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the tumour is ripe, which may be known
by its conical figure, the softness of the skin, and a
fluctuation of matter plainly to be felt under the
finger, it may be opened either by a caustic or a lancet,
and afterwards dressed with digestive ointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>It sometimes however happens, that buboes can
neither be dispersed nor brought to a suppuration,
but remain hard, indolent tumours. In this case
the indurated glands must be consumed by caustic;
if they should become scirrhous, they must be dissolved
by the application of hemlock, both externally
and internally, as directed in the scirrhous
testicle.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_506'>506</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF CHANCRES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Chancres are superficial, callous, eating ulcers;
which may happen either with or without a gonorrhœa.
They are commonly seated about the glans,
and make their appearance in the following manner:
First a little red pimple arises, which soon becomes
pointed at top, and is filled with a whitish
matter inclining to yellow. This pimple is hot, and
itches generally before it breaks: afterwards it degenerates
into an obstinate ulcer, the bottom of
which is usually covered with a viscid mucus, and
whose edges gradually become hard and callous.
Sometimes the first appearance resembles a simple
excoriation of the cuticle; which however, if the
cause be venereal, soon becomes a true chancre.</p>

<p class='c008'>A chancre is sometimes a primary affection, but
it is much oftner symptomatic, and is the mark of
a confirmed lues. Primary chancres discover themselves
soon after impure coition, and are generally
seated in parts covered with a thin cuticle, as the
lips, the nipples of women, the <i>glans penis</i> of men,
&#38;c.<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c010'><sup>[172]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a chancre appears soon after impure coition,
its treatment is nearly similar to that of the
virulent gonorrhœa. The patient must observe the
cooling regimen, lose a little blood, and take some
gentle doses of salts and manna. The parts affected
<span class='pageno' id='Page_507'>507</span>ought frequently to be bathed, or rather
soaked, in warm milk and water, and, if the inflammation
be great, an emollient poultice or cataplasm
may be applied to them. This course will,
in most cases, be sufficient to abate the inflammation,
and prepare the patient for the use of mercury.</p>

<p class='c008'>Symptomatic chancres are commonly accompanied
with ulcers in the throat, nocturnal pains,
scurfy eruptions about the roots of the hair, and
other symptoms of a confirmed lues. Though they
may be seated in any of the parts mentioned above,
they commonly appear upon the private parts, or
the inside of the thigh. They are also less painful,
but frequently much larger and harder than primary
chancres. As their cure must depend upon
that of the pox, of which they are only a symptom,
we shall take no further notice of them, till
we come to treat of a confirmed lues<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c010'><sup>[173]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Thus we have related most of the symptoms which
accompany or succeed a violent gonorrhœa, and
have also given a short view of their proper treatment;
there are, however, several others which
sometimes attend this disease, as a <i>strangury</i> or obstruction
of urine, <i>phymosis</i>, <i>paraphymosis</i>, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A strangury may be occasioned either by a spasmodic
constriction, or an inflammation of the urethra
and parts about the neck of the bladder. In
the former case, the patient begins to void his urine
with tolerable ease; but, as soon as it touches the
galled or inflamed urethra, a sudden constriction
takes place, and the urine is voided by spurts, and
sometimes by drops only. When the strangury is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_508'>508</span>owing to an inflammation about the neck of the
bladder, there is a constant heat and uneasiness of
the part, a perpetual desire to make water, while
the patient can only render a few drops, and a
troublesome <i>tenesmus</i>, or constant inclination to go
to stool.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the strangury is owing to spasm, such medicines
as tend to dilute and blunt the salts of the
urine will be proper. For this purpose, besides
the common diluting liquors, soft and cooling
emulsions, sweetened with the syrup of poppies,
may be used. Should these not have the desired
effect, bleeding, and emollient fomentations, will
be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the complaint is evidently owing to an
inflammation about the neck of the bladder, bleeding
must be more liberally performed, and repeated
according to the urgency of the symptoms.
After bleeding, if the strangury still continues, soft
clysters, with a proper quantity of laudanum in
them, may be administered, and emollient fomentations
applied to the region of the bladder. At
the same time, the patient may take every four
hours a tea-cupful of barley-water, to an English
pint of which six ounces of the syrup of marsh-mallows,
four ounces of the oil of sweet almonds,
and half an ounce of nitre, may be added. If these
remedies should not relieve the complaint, and a
total suppression of urine should come on, bleeding
must be repeated, and the patient set in a warm
bath up to the middle. It will be proper in this
case to discontinue the diuretics, and to draw off
the water with a catheter; but as the patient is seldom
able to bear its being introduced, we would
rather recommend the use of mild bougies. These
often lubricate the passage, and greatly facilitate
the discharge of urine. Whenever they begin to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_509'>509</span>stimulate or give any uneasiness, they may be withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>phymosis</i> is such a constriction of the prepuce
over the glans, as hinders it from being drawn
backwards; the <i>paraphymosis</i>, on the contrary, is
such a constriction of the prepuce behind the glans,
as hinders it from being brought forward.</p>

<p class='c008'>The treatment of these symptoms is so nearly the
same with that of the virulent gonorrhœa, that we
have no occasion to enlarge upon it. In general,
bleeding, purging, poultices, and emollient fomentations
are sufficient. Should these, however,
fail of removing the stricture, and the parts be
threatened with a mortification, twenty or thirty
grains of ipecacuanha, and one grain of emetic
tartar, may be given for a vomit, and may be
worked off with warm water or thin gruel.</p>

<p class='c008'>It sometimes happens, that, in spite of all endeavours
to the contrary, the inflammation goes on,
and symptoms of a beginning mortification appear.
When this is the case, the prepuce must be scarified
with a lancet, and, if necessary, divided, in
order to prevent a strangulation, and set the imprisoned
glans at liberty. We shall not describe
the manner of performing this operation, as it
ought always to be done by a surgeon. When a
mortification has actually taken place, it will be
necessary, besides performing the above operations,
to foment the parts frequently with cloths wrung
out of a strong decoction of camomile-flowers and
bark, and to give the patient a drachm of the bark
in powder every two or three hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the <i>priapism</i>, <i>chordee</i>, and other
distortions of the <i>penis</i>, their treatment is no way
different from that of the gonorrhœa. When they
prove very troublesome, the patient may take a few
drops of laudanum at night, especially after the
operation of a purgative through the day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_510'>510</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF A CONFIRMED LUES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>We have hitherto treated of those affections in
which the venereal poison is supposed to be confined
chiefly to the particular part by which it was received,
and shall next take a view of the lues in its
confirmed state; that is, when the poison is actually
received into the blood, and, circulating with it
through every part of the body, mixes with the
several secretions, and renders the whole habit
tainted.</p>

<p class='c008'>The symptoms of a confirmed lues are, buboes
in the groin, pains of the head and joints, which
are peculiarly troublesome in the night, or when
the patient is warm in bed; scabs and scurfs in various
parts of the body, especially on the head, of
a yellowish colour, resembling a honey-comb; corroding
ulcers in various parts of the body, which
generally begin about the throat, from whence they
creep gradually, by the palate, towards the cartilage
of the nose, which they destroy; excrescences
or exostoses arise in the middle of the bones, and
their spongy ends become brittle, and break upon
the least accident; at other times they are soft, and
bend like wax; the conglobate glands become hard
and callous, and form, in the neck, armpits, groin,
and mesentery, hard moveable tumours, like the
king’s evil; tumours of different kinds are likewise
formed in the lymphatic vessels, tendons, ligaments,
and nerves, as the <i>gummata</i>, <i>ganglia</i>, <i>nodes</i>,
<i>tophs</i>, &#38;c.; the eyes are affected with itching, pain,
redness, and sometimes with total blindness, and
the ears with a singing noise, pain, and deafness,
whilst their internal substance is exulcerated and
rendered carious; at length all the animal, vital,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_511'>511</span>and natural functions are depraved; the face becomes
pale and livid; the body emaciated and unfit
for motion, and the miserable patient falls into
an atrophy or wasting consumption.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women have symptoms peculiar to the sex; as
cancers of the breast; a suppression or overflowing
of the menses; the whites; hysteric affections; an
inflammation, abscess, scirrhus, gangrene, cancer,
or ulcer of the womb; they are generally either
barren or subject to abortion; or, if they bring
children into the world, they have an universal erysipelas,
are half rotten, and covered with ulcers.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such is the catalogue of symptoms attending this
dreadful disease in its confirmed state. Indeed they
are seldom all to be met with in the same person,
or at the same time; so many of them, however,
are generally present as are sufficient to alarm the
patient; and if he has reason to suspect the infection
is lurking in his body, he ought immediately to
set about the expulsion of it, otherwise the most
tragical consequences will ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only certain remedy hitherto known in Europe,
for the cure of this disease, is mercury, which
may be used in a great variety of forms, with nearly
the same success. Some time ago it was reckoned
impossible to cure a confirmed lues without a salivation.
This method is now however pretty generally
laid aside, and mercury is found to be as
efficacious, or rather more so, in expelling the venereal
poison, when administered in such a manner
as not to run off by the salivary glands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though many are of opinion, that the mercurial
ointment is as efficacious as any other preparation
of that mineral; yet experience has taught
me to think otherwise. I have often seen the most
obstinate venereal cases, where great quantities of
mercurial ointment had been used in vain, yield to
the saline preparations of mercury. Nor am I singular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_512'>512</span>in this opinion. My ingenious friend, Mr.
Clare, an eminent surgeon of this city, assures me,
that for some time past he has employed, in venereal
cases, a saline preparation of mercury with
most happy success. This preparation, rubbed with
a sufficient quantity of any mild powder, he applies,
in small portions, to the tongue, where, with a
gentle degree of friction, it is immediately absorbed,
and produces its full effect; upon the system,
without doing the least injury to the stomach
or bowels; a matter of the greatest importance in
the application of this most active and powerful
remedy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is impossible to ascertain either the exact quantity
of medicines that must be taken, or the time
they ought to be continued, in order to perform a
cure. These will ever vary according to the constitution
of the patient, the season of the year, the
degree of infection, the time it has lodged in the
body, &#38;c. But though it is difficult, as Astruc observes,
to determine <i>à priori</i>, what quantity of mercury
will, in the whole, be necessary to cure this
distemper completely; yet it may be judged of <i>à
posteriori</i>, from the abatement and ceasing of the
symptoms. The same author adds, that commonly
not less than two ounces of the strong mercurial
ointment is sufficient, and not more than three or
four ounces necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>The only chemical preparation of mercury which
we shall take notice of, is the corrosive sublimate.
This was some time ago brought into use
for the venereal disease, in Germany, by the illustrious
Baron Van Swieten; and was soon after introduced
into Britain by the learned Sir John
Pringle, at that time physician to the army. The
method of giving it is as follows: One grain of
corrosive sublimate is dissolved in two ounces of
French brandy or malt spirits; and of this solution,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_513'>513</span>an ordinary table-spoonful, or the quantity of half
an ounce, is to be taken twice a-day, and to be
continued as long as any symptoms of the disorder
remain. To those whose stomach cannot bear the
solution, the sublimate may be given in form of
pill<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c010'><sup>[174]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several roots, woods, and barks, have been recommended
for curing the venereal disease; but
none of them have been found, upon experience, to
answer the high encomiums which had been bestowed
upon them. Though no one of these is to
be depended upon alone, yet, when joined with
mercury, some of them are found to be very beneficial
in promoting a cure. One of the best we
know yet is sarsaparilla, which may be prepared
and taken according to the directions in the Appendix<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c010'><sup>[175]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The mezereon root is likewise found to be a
powerful assistant to the sublimate, or any other
mercurial. It may either be used along with the
sarsaparilla, as directed in the Appendix, or by itself.
Those who chuse to use the mezereon by
itself, may boil an ounce of the fresh bark, taken
from the root, in twelve English pints of water to
eight, adding towards the end an ounce of liquorice.
The dose of this is the same as of the
decoction of sarsaparilla.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have been told that the natives of America
cure the venereal disease, in every stage, by a decoction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_514'>514</span>of the root of a plant called the Lobelia.
It is used either fresh or dried; but we have no
certain accounts with regard to the proportion.
Sometimes they mix other roots with it, as those of
the ranunculus, the ceanothus, &#38;c.; but whether
these are designed to disguise or assist it, is doubtful.
The patient takes a large draught of the decoction
early in the morning, and continues to use
it for his ordinary drink through the day<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c010'><sup>[176]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many other roots and woods might be mentioned
which have been extolled for curing the venereal
disease, as the china-root, the roots of soap-wort,
burdock, &#38;c. as also the wood of guaiacum and
sassafras; but as none of these have been found to
possess virtues superior to those already mentioned,
we shall, for the sake of brevity, pass them over,
and shall conclude our observations on this disease
with a few general remarks concerning the proper
management of the patient, and the nature of the infection.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_515'>515</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>GENERAL OBSERVATIONS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The condition of the patient ought always to
be considered previous to his entering upon a
course of mercury in any form. It would be
equally rash and dangerous to administer mercury
to a person labouring under any violent acute disease,
as a putrid fever, pleurisy, peripneumony, or
the like. It would likewise be dangerous in some
chronic cases; as a slow hectic fever, or the last
stage of a consumption. Sometimes, however,
these diseases proceed from a confirmed lues; in
which case it will be necessary to give mercury. In
chronic diseases of a less dangerous nature, as the
asthma, the gravel, and such like, mercury, if necessary,
may be safely administered. If the patient’s
strength has been greatly exhausted by sickness,
labour, abstinence, or any other cause, the
use of mercury must be postponed, till by time,
rest, and a nourishing diet, it can be sufficiently
restored.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mercury ought not to be administered to women
during the menstrual flux, or when the period is
near at hand. Neither should it be given in the
last stage of pregnancy. If, however, the woman
be not near the time of her delivery, and circumstances
render it necessary, mercury may be given,
but in smaller doses, and at greater intervals than
usual: with these precautions, both the mother and
child may be cured at the same time; if not, the
disorder will at least be kept from growing worse,
till the woman be brought to bed, and sufficiently
recovered, when a more effectual method may be
pursued, which, if she suckles her child, will in
all probability be sufficient for the cure of both.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_516'>516</span>Mercury ought always to be administered to infants
with the greatest caution. Their tender condition
unfits them for supporting a salivation, and
makes it necessary to administer even the mildest
preparations of mercury to them with a sparing
hand. A similar conduct is recommended in the
treatment of old persons, who have the misfortune
to labour under a confirmed lues. No doubt the
infirmities of age must render people less able to
undergo the fatigues of a salivation; but this, as
was formerly observed, is never necessary; besides,
we have generally found, that mercury had much
less effect upon very old persons than on those who
were younger.</p>

<p class='c008'>Hysteric and hypochondriac persons, and such
as are subject to an habitual diarrhœa or dysentery,
or to frequent and violent attacks of the epilepsy,
or who are afflicted with the scrophula, or the scurvy,
ought to be cautious in the use of mercury.
Where any one of these disorders prevails, it ought
either, if possible, to be cured, or at least palliated,
before the patient enters upon a course of mercury.
When this cannot be done, the mercury must be
administered in smaller doses, and at longer intervals
than usual.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper seasons for entering upon a
course of mercury, are the spring and autumn,
when the air is of a moderate warmth. If the circumstances
of the case, however, will not admit of
delay, we must not defer the cure on account of the
season, but must administer the mercury; taking
care at the same time to keep the patient’s chamber
warmer or cooler, according as the season of
the year requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next thing to be considered is the preparation
necessary to be observed before we proceed
to administer a course of mercury. Some lay great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_517'>517</span>stress upon this circumstance, observing, that by
previously relaxing the vessels, and correcting any
disorder which may happen to prevail in the blood,
not only the mercury will be disposed to act more
kindly, but many other inconveniencies will be prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>We have already recommended bleeding and
gentle purges, previous to the administration of
mercury, and shall only now add, that these are always
to be repeated according to the age, strength,
constitution, and other circumstances of the patient.
Afterwards, if it can be conveniently done,
the patient ought to bathe once or twice a-day, for
a few days, in lukewarm water. His diet in the
mean time must be light, moist, and cooling.
Wine, and all heating liquors, also violent bodily
exercise, and all great exertions of the mind, are
carefully to be avoided.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proper regimen is likewise to be observed by
such as are under a course of mercury. Inattention
to this not only endangers the patient’s life
but often also disappoints him of a cure. A much
smaller quantity of mercury will be sufficient for
the cure of a person who lives low, keeps warm,
and avoids all manner of excess, than of one who
cannot endure to put the smallest restraint upon his
appetites: indeed it but rarely happens that such
are thoroughly cured.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is hardly any thing of more importance,
either for preventing or removing venereal infection
than cleanliness. By an early attention to
this, the infection might often be prevented from
entering the body; and, where it has already taken
place, its effects may be greatly mitigated.
The moment any person has reason to suspect that
he has received the infection, he ought to wash the
parts with water and spirits, sweet oil, or milk and
water; a small quantity of the last may likewise be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_518'>518</span>injected up the urethra, if it can be conveniently
done. Whether this disease at first took its rise
from dirtiness is hard to say; but wherever that
prevails, the infection is found in its greatest degree
of virulence, which gives ground to believe
that a strict attention to cleanliness would go far towards
extirpating it altogether<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c010'><sup>[177]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the venereal disease has been neglected, or
improperly treated, it often becomes a disorder of
the habit. In this case the cure must be attempted
by restoratives, as a milk diet, the decoction of
sarsaparilla, and such like, to which mercury may
be occasionally added. It is a common practice in
North Britain to send such patients to drink goat-whey.
This is a very proper plan, provided the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_519'>519</span>infection has been totally eradicated before-hand;
but when that is not the case, and the patient trusts
to the whey for finishing his cure, he will often be
disappointed. I have frequently known the disease
return with all its virulence after a course of
goat-whey, even when that course had been thought
quite sufficient for completing the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of the most unfortunate circumstances attending
patients in this disease, is the necessity they
are often laid under of being soon well. This induces
them to take medicine too fast, and to leave it
off too soon. A few grains more of medicine, or
a few days longer confinement, would often be
sufficient to perfect the cure; whereas, by neglect
of these, a small degree of virulence is still left in
the humours, which gradually vitiates, and at
length contaminates the whole mass. To avoid
this, we would advise, that the patient should never
leave off taking medicine immediately upon
the disappearing of the symptoms, but continue it
for some time after, gradually lessening the quantity,
till there is sufficient ground to believe that
the disease is entirely eradicated.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is not only difficult, but absolutely impossible,
to ascertain the exact degree of virulence that may
attend the disease; for which reason it will always
be a much safer rule to continue the use of medicine
too long, than to leave it off too soon. This
seems to be the leading maxim of a modern practitioner
of some note for the venereal disease, who
always orders his patient to perform a quarantine
of at least forty days, during which time he takes
forty bottles of, I suppose, a strong decoction of
sarsaparilla, or some other antivenereal simple.
Whoever takes this method, and adds a sufficient
quantity of corrosive sublimate, or some other
active preparation of mercury to the decoction, will
seldom fail to cure a confirmed lues.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_520'>520</span>It is peculiarly unfortunate for the cure of this
disease, that not one in ten of those who contract
it, are either able or willing to submit to a proper
plan of regimen. The patient is willing to take
medicine; but he must follow his business, and, to
prevent suspicions, must eat and drink like the rest
of the family. This is the true source of nine-tenths
of all the mischief arising from the venereal
disease. I never knew the cure attended with
any great difficulty or danger where the patient
strictly followed the physician’s advice: but a volume
would not be sufficient to point out the dreadful
consequences which proceed from an opposite
conduct. Scirrhous testicles, ulcerous sore throats,
madness, consumptions, carious bones, and a rotten
progeny, are a few of the blessings derived from
this source.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is a species of false reasoning, with regard
to this disease, which proves fatal to many. A
person of a sound constitution contracts a slight
degree of the disorder. He gets well without
taking any great care, or using much medicine,
and hence concludes that this will always be the
case. The next time the disease occurs, though,
ten times more virulent, he pursues the same course,
and his constitution is ruined. Indeed, the different
degrees of virulence in the small-pox are not
greater than in this disease, though, as the learned
Sydenham observes, in some cases the most skilful
physicians cannot cure, and in others the most ignorant
old woman cannot kill the patient in that
disorder. Though a good constitution is always in
favour of the patient, yet too great stress may be
laid upon it. It does not appear from observation,
that the most robust constitution is able to overcome
the virulence of the venereal contagion, after
it has got into the habit. In this case a proper
<span class='pageno' id='Page_521'>521</span>course of medicine is always indispensably necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Although it is impossible, on account of the
different degrees of virulence, &#38;c. to lay down
fixed and certain rules for the cure of this disease,
yet the following general plan will always be found
safe, and often successful, <i>viz.</i> to bleed and administer
gentle purges with diuretics during the inflammatory
state, and as soon as the symptoms of
inflammation are abated, to administer mercury, in
any form that may be most agreeable to the patient.
The same medicine, assisted by the decoction of
sarsaparilla, and a proper regimen, will not only
secure the constitution against the further progress
of a confirmed pox, but will generally perform a
complete cure.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLVIII.<br> <span class='c015'>DISEASES OF WOMEN.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Women, in all civilized nations, have the
management of domestic affairs, and it is very
proper they should, as Nature has made them less
fit for the more active and laborious employments.
This indulgence, however, is generally carried too
far; and females, instead of being benefited by it,
are greatly injured, from the want of exercise and
free air. To be satisfied of this, one need only
compare the fresh and ruddy looks of a milk-maid,
with the pale complexion of those females whose
whole time is spent within doors. Though Nature
has made an evident distinction between the
male and female with regard to bodily strength and
vigour, yet she certainly never meant, either that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_522'>522</span>the one should be always without, or the other always
within doors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The confinement of females, besides hurting
their figure and complexion, relaxes their solids,
weakens their minds, and disorders all the functions
of the body. Hence proceed obstructions,
indigestion, flatulence, abortions, and the whole
train of nervous disorders. These not only unfit
women for being mothers and nurses, but often
render them whimsical and ridiculous. A sound
mind depends so much upon a healthy body, that
where the latter is wanting the former is rarely to
be found.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have always observed, that women who were
chiefly employed without doors, in the different
branches of husbandry, gardening, and the like,
were almost as hardy as their husbands, and that
their children were likewise strong and healthy.
But as the bad effects of confinement and inactivity
upon both sexes have been already shewn, we shall
proceed to point out those circumstances in the
structure and design of females, which subject them
to peculiar diseases; the chief of which are, their
<i>monthly evacuations</i>, <i>pregnancy</i>, and <i>child-bearing</i>.
These indeed cannot properly be called diseases,
but from the delicacy of the sex, and their being
often improperly managed in such situations, they
become the source of numerous calamities.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE MENSTRUAL DISCHARGE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Females generally begin to menstruate about the
age of fifteen, and leave it off about fifty, which
renders these two periods the most critical of their
lives. About the first appearance of this discharge,
the constitution undergoes a very considerable
change, generally indeed for the better, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_523'>523</span>sometimes for the worse. The greatest care is now
necessary, as the future health and happiness of the
female depends in a great measure upon her conduct
at this period<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c010'><sup>[178]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a girl about this time of life be confined to
the house, kept constantly sitting, and neither allowed
to romp about, nor employed in any active
business, which gives exercise to the whole body,
she becomes weak, relaxed, and puny; her blood
not being duly prepared, she looks pale and wan;
her health, spirits, and vigour decline, and she
sinks into a valetudinarian for life. Such is the
fate of numbers of those unhappy females, who,
either from too much indulgence, or their own
narrow circumstances, are, at this critical period,
denied the benefit of exercise and free air.</p>

<p class='c008'>A lazy indolent disposition proves likewise very
hurtful to girls at this period. One seldom meets
with complaints from obstructions amongst the
more active and industrious part of the sex; whereas
the indolent and lazy are seldom free from them.
These are in a manner eaten up by the <i>chlorosis</i>, or
green-sickness, and other diseases of this nature.
We would therefore recommend it to all who wish
to escape these calamities, to avoid indolence and
inactivity, as their greatest enemies, and to be as
much abroad in the open air as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_524'>524</span>Another thing which proves very hurtful to girls
about this period of life, is unwholesome food.
Fond of all manner of trash, they often indulge
in it, till their whole humours are quite vitiated.
Hence ensue indigestions, want of appetite, and a
numerous train of evils. If the fluids be not duly
prepared, it is utterly impossible that the secretions
should go properly on. Accordingly we find, that
such girls as lead an indolent life, and eat great
quantities of trash, are not only subject to obstructions
of the <i>menses</i>, but likewise to glandular obstructions;
as the scrophula, or king’s evil, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>A dull disposition is also very hurtful to girls at
this period. It is a rare thing to see a sprightly
girl who does not enjoy good health, while the
grave, moping, melancholy creature, proves the
very prey of vapours and hysterics. Youth is the
season for mirth and cheerfulness. Let it therefore
be indulged. It is an absolute duty. To lay in a
stock of health in time of youth, is as necessary a
piece of prudence, as to make provision against the
decays of old age. While, therefore, wise Nature
prompts the happy youth to join in sprightly amusements,
let not the severe dictates of hoary age forbid
the useful impulse, nor damp, with serious
gloom, the season destined to mirth and innocent
festivity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another thing very hurtful to females about this
period of life is strait clothes. They are fond of a
fine shape, and foolishly imagine that this can be
acquired by lacing themselves tight. Hence, by
squeezing the stomach and bowels, they hurt the
digestion, and occasion many incurable maladies.
This error is not indeed so common as it has been;
but, as fashions change, it may come about again:
we therefore think it not improper to mention it. I
know many females who, to this day, feel the direful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_525'>525</span>effects of that wretched custom which prevailed
some years ago, of squeezing every girl into as small
a size in the middle as possible. Human invention
could not possibly have devised a practice more destructive
to health.</p>

<p class='c008'>After a female has arrived at that period of life
when the <i>menses</i> usually begin to flow, and they do
not appear, but, on the contrary, her health and
spirits begin to decline, we would advise, instead
of shutting the poor girl up in the house, and
dosing her with steel, asafœtida, and other nauseous
drugs, to place her in a situation where she
can enjoy the benefit of free air and agreeable
company. There let her eat wholesome food, take
sufficient exercise, and amuse herself in the most
agreeable manner; and we have little reason to
fear, but Nature, thus assisted, will do her proper
work. Indeed she seldom fails, unless where the
fault is on our side.</p>

<p class='c008'>This discharge in the beginning is seldom so instantaneous
as to surprise females unawares. It is
generally preceded by symptoms which foretel its
approach; as a sense of heat, weight, and dull
pain in the loins; distension and hardness of the
breasts; head-ach; loss of appetite; lassitude; paleness
of the countenance; and sometimes a slight
degree of fever. When these symptoms appear
about the age at which the menstrual flux usually
begins, every thing should be carefully avoided
which may obstruct that necessary and salutary evacuation;
and all means used to promote it; as sitting
frequently over the steams of warm water,
drinking warm diluting liquors, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the <i>menses</i> have once begun to flow, the
greatest care should be taken to avoid every thing
that may tend to obstruct them. Females ought
to be exceeding cautious of what they eat or drink
at the time they are out of order. Every thing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_526'>526</span>that is cold, or apt to sour on the stomach, ought
to be avoided; as fruit, butter-milk, and such
like. Fish, and all kinds of food that are hard of
digestion, are also to be avoided. As it is impossible
to mention every thing that may disagree
with individuals at this time, we would recommend
it to every female to be very attentive to
what disagrees with herself, and carefully to avoid
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Cold is extremely hurtful at this particular period.
More of the sex date their disorders from
colds, caught while they are out of order, than
from all other causes. This ought surely to put
them upon their guard, and to make them very
circumspect in their conduct at such times. A degree
of cold that will not at the least hurt them at
another time, will at this period be sufficient entirely
to ruin their health and constitution.</p>

<p class='c008'>The greatest attention ought likewise to be paid
to the mind, which should be kept as easy and
cheerful as possible. Every part of the animal economy
is influenced by the passions, but none more
so than this. Anger, fear, grief, and other affections
of the mind, often occasion obstructions of
the menstrual flux, which prove absolutely incurable.</p>

<p class='c008'>From whatever cause this flux is obstructed, except
in the state of pregnancy, proper means should
be used to restore it. For this purpose we would
recommend sufficient exercise, in a dry, open, and
rather cool air; wholesome diet, and, if the body
be weak and languid, generous liquors; also cheerful
company and all manner of amusements. If
these fail, recourse must be had to medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>When obstructions proceed from a weak relaxed
state of the solids, such medicines as tend to promote
digestion, to brace the solids, and assist the
body in preparing good blood, ought to be used.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_527'>527</span>The principal of these are iron and the Peruvian
bark, with other bitter and astringent medicines.
Filings of iron may be infused in wine or ale, two
or three ounces to an English quart, and after it
has stood for two or three weeks it may be filtered,
and about half a wine-glass of it taken twice a-day:
or prepared steel may be taken in the dose of half
a drachm, mixed with a little honey or treacle,
three or four times a-day. The bark and other
bitters may either be taken in substance or infusion,
as is most agreeable to the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>When obstructions proceed from a viscid state of
the blood; or for women of a gross or full habit,
evacuations, and such medicines as attenuate the
humours, are necessary. The patient in this case
ought to be bled, to bathe her feet frequently in
warm water, to take now and then a cooling purge,
and to live upon a spare thin diet. Her drink
should be whey, water, or small beer, and she
ought to take sufficient exercise. A tea-spoonful
of the tincture of black hellebore may also be
taken twice a-day in a cup of warm water.</p>

<p class='c008'>When obstructions proceed from affections of
the mind, as grief, fear, anger, &#38;c. every method
should be taken to amuse and divert the patient.
And that she may the more readily forget
the cause of her affliction, she ought, if possible,
to be removed from the place where it happened.
A change of place, by presenting the mind with a
variety of new objects, has often a very happy influence
in relieving it from the deepest distress. A
soothing, kind, and affable behaviour to females in
this situation is also of the last importance.</p>

<p class='c008'>An obstruction of the <i>menses</i> is often the effect of
other maladies. When this is the case, instead of
giving medicines to force that discharge, which
might be dangerous, we ought by all means to endeavour
to restore the patient’s health and strength.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_528'>528</span>When that is effected, the other will return of
course.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the menstrual flux may be too great as well
as too small. When this happens, the patient becomes
weak, the colour pale, the appetite and digestion
are bad, and œdematous swellings of the
feet, dropsies, and consumptions often ensue. This
frequently happens to women about the age of
forty-five or fifty, and is very difficult to cure. It
may proceed from a sedentary life; a full diet,
consisting chiefly of salted, high-seasoned, or acrid
food; the use of spirituous liquors; excessive fatigue;
relaxation; a dissolved state of the blood;
violent passions of the mind, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The treatment of this disease must be varied according
to its cause. When it is occasioned by
any error in the patient’s regimen, an opposite
course to that which induced the disorder must be
pursued, and such medicines taken as have a tendency
to restrain the flux, and counteract the morbid
affections of the system from whence it proceeds.</p>

<p class='c008'>To restrain the flux, the patient should be kept
quiet and easy both in body and mind. If it be
very violent, she ought to lie in bed with her head
low; to live upon a cool and slender diet, as veal or
chicken broths with bread; and to drink decoctions
of nettle-roots, or the greater comfrey. If these
be not sufficient to stop the flux, stronger astringents
may be used, as Japan earth, allum, elixir
of vitriol, the Peruvian bark, &#38;c.<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c010'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_529'>529</span>The <i>uterine flux</i> may offend in quality as well as
in quantity. What is usually called the <i>fluor albus</i>,
or whites, is a very common disease, and proves
extremely hurtful to delicate women. This discharge,
however, is not always white, but sometimes
pale, yellow, green, or of a blackish colour;
sometimes it is sharp and corrosive, sometimes foul
and fœtid, &#38;c. It is attended with a pale complexion,
pain in the back, loss of appetite, swelling
of the feet, and other signs of debility. It generally
proceeds from a relaxed state of the body,
arising from indolence, the excessive use of tea,
coffee, or other weak and watery diet.</p>

<p class='c008'>To remove this disease, the patient must take as
much exercise as she can bear without fatigue. Her
food should be solid and nourishing, but of easy
digestion; and her drink rather generous, as red
port or claret, mixed with Pyrmont, Bristol, or
lime-water. Tea and coffee are to be avoided. I
have often known strong broths have an exceeding
good effect, and sometimes a milk diet alone will
perform a cure. The patient ought not to lie too
long a-bed. When medicine is necessary, we know
none preferable to the Peruvian bark, which in this
case ought always to be taken in substance. In
warm weather, the cold bath will be of considerable
service.</p>

<p class='c008'>That period of life at which the <i>menses</i> cease to
flow, is likewise very critical to the sex. The
stoppage of any customary evacuation, however
small, is sufficient to disorder the whole frame, and
often to destroy life itself. Hence it comes to pass,
that so many women either fall into chronic disorders,
or die about this time. Such of them, however,
as survive it, without contracting any chronic
disease, often become more healthy and hardy than
they were before, and enjoy strength and vigour
to a very great age.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_530'>530</span>If the <i>menses</i> cease all of a sudden, in women
of a full habit, they ought to abate somewhat of
their usual quantity of food, especially of the more
nourishing kind, as flesh, eggs, &#38;c. They ought
likewise to take sufficient exercise, and to keep the
body open. This may be done by taking, once or
twice a-week, a little rhubarb, or an infusion of
hiera picra in wine or brandy.</p>

<p class='c008'>It often happens that women of a gross habit, at
this period of life, have ulcerous sores break out
about their ancles, or in other parts of the body.
Such ulcers ought to be considered as critical, and
should either be suffered to continue open, or have
artificial drains substituted in their stead. Women
who will have such sores dried up, are often soon
after carried off by acute diseases, or fall into those
of a chronic nature.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF PREGNANCY.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though pregnancy is not a disease, yet that state
is often attended with a variety of complaints which
merit attention, and which sometimes require the
assistance of medicine. Some women indeed are
more healthy during their pregnancy than at any
other time; but this is by no means the general
case: most of them <i>breed in sorrow</i>, and are frequently
indisposed during the whole time of pregnancy.
Few fatal diseases, however, happen during
that period; and hardly any, except abortion,
that can be called dangerous. We shall therefore
pay particular attention to it, as it proves generally
fatal to the child, and sometimes so to the
mother.</p>

<p class='c008'>Pregnant women are often afflicted with the
heart-burn. The method of treating this complaint
has been already pointed out. They are likewise,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_531'>531</span>in the more early periods of pregnancy, often harassed
with sickness and vomiting, especially in the
morning. The method of relieving these complaints
has also been shewn. Both the head-ach
and tooth-ach are very troublesome symptoms of
pregnancy. The former may generally be removed
by keeping the body gently open, by the use of
prunes, figs, roasted apples, and such like. When
the pain is very violent, bleeding may be necessary.
For the treatment of the latter, we must refer
to that article. Several other complaints incident
to pregnant women might be mentioned, as a
cough and difficulty of breathing, suppression and
incontinency of urine, &#38;c.; but as all of these
have been taken notice of before, it is needless to
repeat them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every pregnant woman is more or less in danger
of abortion. This should be guarded against with
the greatest care, as it not only weakens the constitution,
but renders the woman liable to the
same misfortune afterwards<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c010'><sup>[180]</sup></a>. Abortion may happen
at any period of pregnancy, but it is most
common in the second or third month. Sometimes,
however, it happens in the fourth or fifth.
If it happens within the first month, it is usually
called a false conception; if after the seventh
month, the child may often be kept alive by proper
care.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common causes of abortion are, the death of
the child; weakness or relaxation of the mother;
great evacuations; violent exercise; raising great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_532'>532</span>weights; reaching too high; jumping, or stepping
from an eminence; vomiting; coughing; convulsion
fits; blows on the belly; falls; fevers; disagreeable
smells; excess of blood; indolence;
high living; or the contrary; violent passions or
affections of the mind, as fear, grief, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The signs of approaching abortion are, pain in
the loins, or about the bottom of the belly; a dull
heavy pain in the inside of the thighs; a slight degree
of coldness, or shivering; sickness, palpitation
of the heart; the breasts become flat and soft;
the belly falls; and there is a discharge of blood
or watery humours from the womb.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent abortion, we would advise women
of a weak or relaxed habit to use solid food, avoiding
great quantities of tea, and other weak and
watery liquors; to rise early and go soon to bed;
to shun damp houses; to take frequent exercise in
the open air, but to avoid fatigue; and never to
go abroad in damp foggy weather, if they can
shun it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Women of a full habit ought to use a spare
diet, avoiding strong liquors, and every thing that
may tend to heat the body, or increase the quantity
of blood. Their diet should be of an opening
nature, consisting principally of vegetable substances.
Every woman with child ought to be
kept cheerful and easy in her mind. Her appetites,
even though depraved, ought to be indulged as far
as prudence will permit.</p>

<p class='c008'>When any signs of abortion appear, the woman
ought to be laid in bed on a mattrass, with her
head low. She should be kept quiet, and her
mind soothed and comforted. She ought not to
be kept too hot, nor to take any thing of a heating
nature. Her food should consist of broths,
rice and milk, jellies, gruels made of oatmeal,
and the like, all of which ought to be taken cold.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_533'>533</span>If she be able to bear it, she should lose at least
half a pound of blood from the arm. Her drink
ought to be barley-water sharpened with juice of
lemon; or she may take half a drachm of powdered
nitre, in a cup of water-gruel, every five or
six hours. If the woman be seized with a violent
looseness, she ought to drink the decoction of calcined
hartshorn prepared. If she be affected with
vomiting, let her take frequently two table-spoonfuls
of the saline mixture. In general, opiates
are of service; but they should always be given
with caution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sanguine robust women, who are liable to miscarry
at a certain time of pregnancy, ought always
to be bled a few days before that period arrives.
By this means, and observing the regimen above
prescribed, they might often escape that misfortune.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though we recommend due care for preventing
abortion, we would not be understood as restraining
pregnant women from their usual exercises.
This would generally operate the quite contrary
way. Want of exercise not only relaxes the body,
but induces a plethora, or <a id='t533'></a>too great a fulness of
the vessels, which are the two principal causes of
abortion. There are, however, some women of so
delicate a texture, that it is necessary for them to
avoid almost every kind of exercise during the
whole period of pregnancy.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF CHILD-BIRTH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Many diseases proceed from the want of due care
in child-bed; and the more hardy part of the sex
are most apt to despise the necessary precautions in
this state. This is peculiarly the case with young
wives. They think, when the labour-pains are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_534'>534</span>ended, the danger is over; but in truth it may
only then be said to be begun. Nature, if left to
herself, will seldom fail to expel the <i>fœtus</i>; but proper
care and management are certainly necessary
for the recovery of the mother. No doubt mischief
may be done by too much as well as by too
little care. Hence females who have the greatest
number of attendants in child-bed generally recover
worst. But this is not peculiar to the state of
child-bed. Excessive care always defeats its own intention,
and is generally more dangerous than none
at all<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c010'><sup>[181]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>During actual labour, nothing of a heating nature
ought to be given. The woman may now
and then take a little panado, and her drink ought
to be toast and water, or thin groat-gruel. Spirits,
wines, cordial waters, and other things which are
given with a view to strengthen the mother, and
promote the birth, for the most part tend only to
increase the fever, inflame the womb, and retard
the labour. Besides, they endanger the woman
afterwards, as they often occasion violent and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_535'>535</span>mortal hæmorrhages, or dispose her to eruptive
and other fevers.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the labour proves tedious and difficult, to
prevent inflammations, it will be proper to bleed.
An emollient clyster ought likewise frequently to
be administered; and the patient should sit over the
steams of warm water. The passage ought to be
gently rubbed with a little soft <i>pomatum</i> or fresh
butter, and cloths wrung out of warm water applied
over the belly. If nature seems to sink, and
the woman is greatly exhausted with fatigue, a
draught of generous wine, or some other cordial,
may be given, but not otherwise. These directions
are sufficient in natural labours; and in all
preternatural cases, a skilful surgeon, or man-midwife,
ought to be called as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>After delivery, the woman ought to be kept as
quiet and easy as possible<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c010'><sup>[182]</sup></a>. Her food should be
light and thin, as gruel, panado, &#38;c. and her
drink weak and diluting. To this rule, however,
there are many exceptions. I have known several
women, whose spirits could not be supported in
child-bed without solid food and generous liquors;
to such, a glass of wine and a bit of chicken must
be allowed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes an excessive hæmorrhage or flooding
happens after delivery. In this case the patient
should be laid with her head low, kept cool, and
be in all respects treated as for an excessive flux of
the <i>menses</i>. If the flooding proves violent, linen
cloths, which have been wrung out of a mixture of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_536'>536</span>equal parts of vinegar and water, or red wine,
should be applied to the belly, the loins, and the
thighs: these must be changed as they grow dry;
and may be discontinued as soon as the flooding
abates<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c010'><sup>[183]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>If there be violent pains after delivery, the patient
ought to drink plentifully of warm diluting
liquors, as groat-gruel, or tea with a little saffron
in it; and to take small broths, with carrawayseeds,
or a bit of orange-peel in them; an ounce
of the oil of sweet almonds may likewise be frequently
taken in a cup of any of the above liquors;
and if the patient be restless, a spoonful of the syrup
of poppies may now and then be mixed with a
cup of her drink. If she be hot or feverish, one
of the following powders may be taken in a cup of
her usual drink every five or six hours<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c010'><sup>[184]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>An inflammation of the womb is a dangerous
and not unfrequent disease after delivery. It is
known by pains in the lower part of the belly,
which are greatly increased upon touching; by the
tension or tightness of the parts; great weakness;
change of countenance; a constant fever, with a
weak and hard pulse; a slight <i>delirium</i> or raving;
sometimes incessant vomiting; a hiccup; a discharge
of reddish, stinking, sharp water from the
womb; an inclination to go frequently to stool; a
heat, and sometimes total suppression of urine.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_537'>537</span>This must be treated like other inflammatory
disorders, by bleeding and plentiful dilution. The
drink may be thin gruel or barley-water; in a cup
of which half a drachm of nitre may be dissolved,
and taken three or four times a-day. Clysters of
warm milk and water must be frequently administered;
and the belly should be fomented by cloths
wrung out of warm water, or by applying bladders
filled with warm milk and water to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>A suppression of the <i>lochia</i>, or usual discharges
after delivery, and the milk-fever, must be treated
nearly in the same manner as an inflammation of
the womb. In all these cases, the safest course is
plentiful dilution, gentle evacuations, and fomentations
of the parts affected. In the milk-fever, the
breads may be embrocated with a little warm linseed oil,
or the leaves of red cabbage may be applied
to them. The child should be often put to
the breast, or it should be drawn by some other
person.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nothing would tend more to prevent the milk-fever
than putting the child early to the breast.
The custom of not allowing children to suck for
the first two or three days, is contrary to Nature
and common sense, and is very hurtful both to the
mother and child.</p>

<p class='c008'>Every mother who has milk in her breasts, ought
either to suckle her own child, or to have her
breasts frequently drawn, at least for the first month.
This would prevent many of the diseases which
prove fatal to women in child-bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an inflammation happens in the breast, attended
with redness, hardness, and other symptoms
of suppuration, the safest application is a poultice
of bread and milk, softened with oil or fresh butter.
This may be renewed twice a-day, till the tumour
be either discussed or brought to suppuration.
The use of repellents, in this case, is very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_538'>538</span>dangerous; they often occasion fevers, and sometimes
cancers; whereas a suppuration is seldom attended
with any danger, and has often the most salutary
effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the nipples are fretted or chapt, they
may be anointed with a mixture of oil and beeswax,
or a little powdered gum-arabic may be
sprinkled on them. I have seen Hungary water
applied to the nipples have a very good effect.
Should the complaint prove obstinate, a cooling
purge may be given, which generally removes
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The miliary fever is a disease incident to women
in child-bed; but as it has been treated of already,
we shall take no further notice of it. The celebrated
Hoffman observes, That this fever of child-bed
women might generally be prevented, if they,
during their pregnancy, were regular in their diet,
used moderate exercise, took now and then a gentle
laxative of manna, rhubarb, or cream of tartar;
not forgetting to bleed in the first months, and
avoid all sharp air. When the labour is coming
on, it is not to be hastened with forcing medicines,
which inflame the blood and humours, or put
them into unnatural commotions. Care should be
taken, after the birth, that the natural excretions
proceed regularly; and if the pulse be quick, a
little nitrous powder, or some other cooling medicines,
should be administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most fatal disorder consequent upon delivery
is the <i>puerperal</i>, or child-bed fever. It generally
makes its attack upon the second or third day
after delivery. Sometimes indeed it comes on
sooner, and at other times, though rarely, it does
not appear before the fifth or sixth day.</p>

<p class='c008'>It begins, like most other fevers, with a cold or
shivering fit, which is succeeded by restlessness,
pain of the head, great sickness at stomach, and bilious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_539'>539</span>vomiting. The pulse is generally quick, the
tongue dry, and there is a remarkable depression of
spirits and loss of strength. A great pain is usually
felt in the back, hips, and region of the womb; a
sudden change in the quantity or quality of the <i>lochia</i>
also takes place; and the patient is frequently
troubled with a <i>tenesmus</i>, or constant inclination to
go to stool. The urine, which is very high-coloured,
is discharged in small quantity, and generally
with pain. The belly sometimes swells to a
considerable bulk, and becomes susceptible of pain
from the slightest touch. When the fever has continued
for a few days, the symptoms of inflammation
usually subside, and the disease acquires a
more putrid form. At this period, if not sooner,
a bilious or putrid looseness, of an obstinate and
dangerous nature, comes on, and accompanies the
disease through all its future progress.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is not any disease that requires to be treated
with more skill and attention than this; consequently
the best assistance ought always to be obtained
as soon as possible. In women of plethoric
constitutions, bleeding will generally be proper at
the beginning; it ought however to be used with
caution, and not to be repeated unless where the
signs of inflammation rise high; in which case it
will also be necessary to apply a blistering-plaster to
the region of the womb.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the rigour, or cold fit, proper means
should be used to abate its violence, and shorten its
duration. For this purpose the patient may drink
freely of warm diluting liquors, and, if low, may
take now and then a cup of whine-whey; warm applications
to the extremities, as heated bricks,
bottles or bladders filled with warm water, and
such like, may also be used with advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Emollient clysters of milk and water, or of
chicken water, ought to be frequently administered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_540'>540</span>through the course of the disease. These prove
beneficial by promoting a discharge from the intestines,
and also by acting as a kindly fomentation
to the womb and parts adjacent. Great care
however is requisite in giving them, on account of
the tenderness of the parts in the <i>pelvis</i> at this
time.</p>

<p class='c008'>To evacuate the offending bile from the stomach,
a vomit is generally given. But as this is apt to
increase the irritability of the stomach, already too
great, it will be safer to omit it, and to give in its
stead a gentle laxative, which will both tend to
cool the body, and to procure a free discharge of
the bile<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c010'><sup>[185]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The medicine which I have always found to succeed
best in this disease is the saline draught. This,
if frequently repeated, will often put a stop to the
vomiting, and at the same time lessen the violence
of the fever. If it runs off by stool, or if the patient
be restless, a few drops of laudanum, or some
syrup of poppies, may occasionally be added.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the stools should prove so frequent as to
weaken and exhaust the patient, a starch clyster, with
thirty or forty drops of laudanum in it, may be administered
as occasion shall require; and the drink
may be rice-water, in every English pint of which
half an ounce of gum-arabic has been dissolved.
Should these fail, recourse must be had to Columbo-root,
or some other strong astringent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though in general the food ought to be light,
and the drink diluting, yet when the disease has
been long protracted, and the patient is greatly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_541'>541</span>spent by evacuations, it will be necessary to support
her with nourishing diet and generous cordials.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was observed that this fever, after continuing
for some time, often acquires a putrid form. In
this case the Peruvian bark must be given, either
by itself, or joined with cordials, as circumstances
may require. As the bark in substance will be
apt to purge, it may be given in decoction or infusion
mixed with the tincture of roses, or other
gentle astringents; or, a scruple of the extract of
bark with half an ounce of spirituous cinnamon-water,
two ounces of common water, and ten drops
of laudanum, may be made into a draught, and
given every second, third, or fourth hour, as shall
be found necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the stomach will not bear any kind of
nourishment, the patient may be supported for
some time by clysters of beef tea, or chicken water.</p>

<p class='c008'>To avoid this fever, every woman in child-bed
ought to be kept perfectly easy; her food should
be light and simple, and her bed-chamber cool,
and properly ventilated. There is not any thing
more hurtful to a woman in this situation than being
kept too warm. She ought not to have her
body bound too tight, nor to rise too soon from
bed, after delivery; catching cold is also to be
avoided; and a proper attention should be paid to
cleanliness.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent the milk-fever, the breast ought to
be frequently drawn; and if they are filled previous
to the onset of a fever, they should, upon its
first appearance, be drawn, to prevent the milk
from becoming acrid, and its being absorbed in
this state. Costiveness is likewise to be avoided.
This will be best effected by the use of mild clysters
and a laxative diet.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_542'>542</span>We shall conclude our observations on child-bed
women by recommending it to them, above all
things, to beware of cold. Poor women, whose
circumstances oblige them to quit their bed too
soon, often contract diseases from cold, of which
they never recover. It is pity the poor are not
better taken care of in this situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the better sort of women run the greatest
hazard from too much heat. They are generally
kept in a sort of bagnio for the first eight or ten
days, and then dressed out to see company. The
danger of this conduct must be obvious to every
one.</p>

<p class='c008'>The superstitious custom of obliging women to
keep the house till they go to church, is likewise a
very common cause of catching cold. All churches
are damp, and most of them cold; consequently
they are the very word places to which a woman
can go to make her first visit, after having been
confined in a warm room for a month.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF BARRENNESS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Barrenness may be very properly reckoned
among the diseases of females, as few married women
who have not children enjoy a good state of
health. It may proceed from various causes, as
high living, grief, relaxation, &#38;c. but it is chiefly
owing to an obstruction or irregularity of the menstrual
flux.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is very certain that high living vitiates the
humours, and prevents fecundity. We seldom
find a barren woman among the labouring poor,
while nothing is more common among the rich and
affluent. The inhabitants of every country are prolific
in proportion to their poverty; and it would
be an easy matter to adduce many instances of women,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_543'>543</span>who, by being reduced to live entirely upon
a milk and vegetable diet, have conceived and
brought forth children, though they never had
any before. Would the rich use the same sort of
food and exercise as the better sort of peasants,
they would seldom have cause to envy their poor
vassals and dependants the blessing of a numerous
and healthy offspring, while they pine in sorrow
for the want of even a single heir to their extensive
domains.</p>

<p class='c008'>Affluence begets indolence, which not only vitiates
the humours, but induces a general relaxation
of the solids; a state, highly unfavourable to
procreation. To remove this, we would recommend
the following course: First, sufficient exercise
in the open air; secondly, a diet consisting
chiefly of milk and vegetables<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c010'><sup>[186]</sup></a>; thirdly, the use
of astringent medicines, as steel, allum, dragon’s
blood, elixir of vitriol, the Spaw or Tunbridge
waters, Peruvian bark, &#38;c.; and lastly, above all,
the cold bath.</p>

<p class='c008'>Barrenness is often the consequence of grief,
sudden fear, anxiety, or any of the passions which
tend to obstruct the menstrual flux. When barrenness
is suspected to proceed from affections of
the mind, the person ought to be kept as easy and
cheerful as possible; all disagreeable objects are to
be avoided, and every method taken to amuse and
entertain the fancy.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_544'>544</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. XLIX.<br> <span class='c015'>DISEASES OF CHILDREN.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Miserable indeed is the lot of man in the
state of infancy! He comes into the world
more helpless than any other animal, and stands
much longer in need of the protection and care of
his parents; but, alas! this care is not always bestowed
upon him; and when it is, he often suffers
as much from improper management as he would
have done from neglect. Hence the officious care
of parents, nurses, and midwives, becomes one
of the most fruitful sources of the disorders of infants<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c010'><sup>[187]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>It must be obvious to every attentive person,
that the first diseases of infants arise chiefly from
their bowels. Nor is this in the least to be wondered
at, as they are in a manner poisoned with
indigestible drugs and improper diet as soon as they
come into the world. Every thing that the stomach
cannot digest may be Considered as a poison;
and unless it can be thrown up, or voided by
stool, it must occasion sickness, gripes, spasmodic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_545'>545</span>affections of the bowels, or what the good women
call inward fits, and at last convulsions and
death.</p>

<p class='c008'>As these symptoms evidently arise from somewhat
that irritates the intestines, doubtless the proper
method of cure must be to expel it as soon as
possible. The most safe and effectual method of
doing this is by gentle vomits. Five or six grains
of the powder of ipecacuanha may be mixed in
two table-spoonfuls of water, and sweetened with
a little sugar. A tea-spoonful of this may be given
to the infant every quarter of an hour till it operates;
or, what will more certainly answer the purpose,
a grain of emetic tartar may be dissolved in
three ounces of water, sweetened with a little syrup,
and given as above. Those who are unwilling to
use the emetic tartar, may give six or seven drops
of the antimonial wine, in a tea-spoonful of water
or thin gruel. Small doses of the ipecacuanha wine
will be found more gentle than any of the above,
and ought to be preferred.</p>

<p class='c008'>These medicines will not only cleanse the stomach,
but will generally likewise open the body.
Should this however not happen, and if the child
be costive, some gentle purge will be necessary:
for this purpose, some manna and pulp of cassia
may be dissolved in boiling water, and given in
small quantities till it operates; or, what will answer
rather better, a few grains of <i>magnesia alba</i> may
be mixed in any kind of food that is given to the
child, and continued till it has the desired effect.
If these medicines be properly administered, and
the child’s belly and limbs frequently rubbed with
a warm hand before the fire, they will seldom fail
to relieve those affections of the stomach and bowels
from which infants suffer so much.</p>

<p class='c008'>These general directions include most of what
can be done for relieving the internal disorders of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_546'>546</span>infants. They will likewise go a considerable way
in alleviating those which appear externally, as the
rash, <i>gum</i>, or <i>fellon</i>, &#38;c. These, as was formerly
observed, are principally owing to too hot a regimen,
and consequently will be most effectually relieved
by gentle evacuations. Indeed, evacuations
of one kind or other constitute a principal part of
the medicine of infants, and will seldom, if administered
with prudence, in any of their diseases, fail
to give relief.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF THE MECONIUM.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The stomach and bowels of a new-born infant
are filled with a blackish-coloured matter of the
consistence of syrup, commonly called the <i>meconium</i>.
This is generally passed soon after the birth,
by the mere effort of Nature; in which case it is
not necessary to give the infant any kind of medicine.
But if it should be retained, or not sufficiently
carried off, a little manna or <i>magnesia alba</i> may
be given, as mentioned above; or, if these should
not be at hand, a common spoonful of whey, sweetened
with a little honey, or raw sugar, will answer
the purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper medicine for expelling the <i>meconium</i>
is the mother’s milk, which is always at first
of a purgative quality. Were children allowed to
suck as soon as they shew an inclination for the
breast, they would seldom have occasion for medicines
to discharge the <i>meconium</i>; but even where
this is not allowed, they ought never to have
daubs of syrup, oils, and other indigestible stuff,
crammed down their throats.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_547'>547</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>THE APHTHÆ OR THRUSH.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The aphthæ are little whitish ulcers affecting the
whole inside of the mouth, tongue, throat, and
stomach of infants. Sometimes they reach through
the whole intestinal canal; in which case they are
very dangerous, and often put an end to the infant’s
life.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the aphthæ are of a pale colour, pellucid, few
in number, soft, superficial, and fall easily off, they
are not dangerous; but if opake, yellow, brown,
black, thick, or running together, they ought to be
dreaded.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is generally thought that the aphthæ owe their
origin to acid humours; we have reason however to
believe, they are more frequently owing to too hot
a regimen both of the mother and child. It is a
rare thing to find a child who is not dosed with
wine, punch, cinnamon-waters, or some other hot
and inflaming liquors, almost as soon as it is born.
It is well known that these will occasion inflammatory
disorders even in adults; is it any wonder then
that they should heat and inflame the tender bodies
of infants, and set as it were the whole constitution
on a blaze?</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper medicines for the aphthæ are
vomits, such as have been already recommended,
and gentle laxatives. Five grains of rhubarb and
half a drachm of <i>magnesia alba</i> may be rubbed together,
and divided into six doses, one of which
may be given to the infant every four or five hours
till they operate. These powders may either be
given in the child’s food, or a little of the syrup
of pale roses, and may be repeated as often as is
found necessary to keep the body open. It is common
<span class='pageno' id='Page_548'>548</span>in this case to administer calomel; but as that
medicine sometimes occasions gripes, it ought always
to be given to infants with caution.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many things have been recommended for gargling
the mouth and throat in this disease; but it is
not easy to apply these in very young infants; we
would therefore recommend it to the nurse to rub
the child’s mouth frequently with a little borax and
honey; or with the following mixture: Take fine
honey an ounce, borax a drachm, burnt alum half
a drachm, rose-water two drachms; mix them together.
A very proper application in this case, is
a solution of ten or twelve grains of white vitriol in
eight ounces of barley-water. These may be applied
with the finger, or by means of a bit of soft
rag tied to the end of a probe.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF ACIDITIES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The food of children being for the most part of
an acescent nature, it readily turns sour upon the
stomach, especially if the body be any way disordered.
Hence most diseases of children are accompanied
with evident signs of acidity, as green
stools, gripes, &#38;c. These appearances have induced
many to believe, that all the diseases of children
were owing to an acid abounding in the stomach
and bowels; but whoever considers the matter
attentively, will find that these symptoms of
acidity are oftner the effect than the cause of their
diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nature evidently intended, that the food of children
should be acescent; and unless the body be
disordered, or the digestion hurt, from some other
cause, we will venture to say, that the acescent
quality of their food is seldom injurious to them.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_549'>549</span>Acidity, however, is often a symptom of disorders
in children, and, as it is sometimes a troublesome
one, we shall point out the method of relieving
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When green stools, gripes, purgings, sour smells,
&#38;c. shew that the bowels abound with an acid, the
child should have a little small broth, with light
white bread in it; and should have sufficient exercise
in order to promote the digestion. It has been
customary in this case to give the pearl-julep, chalk,
crabs eyes, and other testaceous powders. These,
indeed, by their absorbent quality, may correct
the acidity; but they are attended with this inconvenience,
that they are apt to lodge in the bowels,
and occasion costiveness, which may prove very
hurtful to the infant. For this reason they should
never be given unless mixed with purgative medicines;
as rhubarb, manna, or such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best medicine which we know, in all cases
of acidity, is that fine insipid powder called <i>magnesia
alba</i>. It purges, and at the same time corrects
the acidity: by which means it not only removes
the disease, but carries off its cause. It
may be given in any kind of food, or in a mixture,
as recommended in the Appendix<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c010'><sup>[188]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When an infant is troubled with gripes, it ought
not at first to be dosed with brandy, spiceries, and
other hot things, but should have its body opened
with an emollient clyster, or the medicine mentioned
above; and at the same time a little brandy
may be rubbed on its belly with a warm hand before
the fire. I have seldom seen this fail to ease
the gripes of infants. If it should happen, however,
not to succeed, a little brandy or other spirits
may be mixed with thrice the quantity of warm
water, and a tea-spoonful of it given frequently till
<span class='pageno' id='Page_550'>550</span>the infant be easier. Sometimes a little peppermint-water
will answer this purpose very well.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>GALLING AND EXCORIATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>These are very troublesome to children. They
happen chiefly about the groin and wrinkles of the
neck, under the arms, behind the ears, and in
other parts that are moistened by the sweat or
urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>As these complaints are, in a great measure, owing
to want of cleanliness, the most effectual means
of preventing them are, to wash the parts frequently
with cold water, to change the linen often,
and, in a word, to keep the child in all respects
thoroughly clean. When this is not sufficient, the
excoriated parts may be sprinkled with absorbent
or drying powders; as burnt hartshorn, tutty,
chalk, crabs claws prepared, and the like. When
the parts affected are very sore, and tend to a real
ulceration, it will be proper to add a little sugar of
lead to the powders; or to anoint the place with
the camphorated ointment. If the parts be washed
with spring water, in which a little white vitriol
has been dissolved, it will dry and heal them very
powerfully. One of the best applications for this
purpose, is to dissolve some fuller’s earth in a sufficient
quantity of hot water; and after it has stood
till it is cold, to rub it gently upon the galled parts
once or twice a-day.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>STOPPAGE OF THE NOSE.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The nostrils of infants are often plugged up with
a gross <i>mucus</i>, which prevents their breathing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_551'>551</span>freely, and likewise renders it difficult for them
to suck or swallow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some in this case order, after a suitable purge,
two or three grains of white vitriol dissolved in half
an ounce of marjoram-water, and filtered, to be applied
now and then to the nostrils with a linen rag.
Wedelius says, If two grains of white vitriol, and
the same quantity of <i>elaterium</i>, be dissolved in half
an ounce of marjoram-water, and applied to the
nose, as above directed, that it brings away the <i>mucus</i>
without sneezing.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstinate cases these medicines may be tried;
but I have never found any thing necessary, besides
rubbing the nose at bed-time with a little sweet oil,
or fresh butter. This resolves the filth, and renders
the breathing more free<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c010'><sup>[189]</sup></a>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF VOMITING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>From the delicate state of children, and the great
sensibility of their organs, a vomiting or looseness
may be induced by any thing that irritates the
nerves of the stomach or intestines. Hence these
disorders are much more common in childhood
than in the more advanced periods of life. They
are seldom however dangerous, and ought never
to be considered as diseases, unless when they are
violent, or continue so long as to exhaust the
strength of the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vomiting may be excited by an over-quantity of
food; by food that is of such a nature as to irritate
the nerves of the stomach too much; or by the sensibility
of the nerves being so much increased as to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_552'>552</span>render them unable to bear the stimulus of even the
mildest element.</p>

<p class='c008'>When vomiting is occasioned by too much food,
it ought to be promoted, as the cure will depend
upon cleansing the stomach. This may be done
either by a few grains of ipecacuanha, or a weak
solution of emetic tartar, as mentioned before.
When it is owing to food of an acrid or irritating
quality, the diet ought to be changed, and aliment
of a milder nature substituted in its stead.</p>

<p class='c008'>When vomiting proceeds from an increased degree
of sensibility, or too great an irritability of
the nerves of the stomach, such medicines as have
a tendency to brace and strengthen that organ, and
to abate its sensibility, must be used. The first of
these intentions may be answered by a slight infusion
of the Peruvian bark, with the addition of a
little rhubarb and orange-peel; and the second by
the saline draughts, to which a few drops of liquid
laudanum may be occasionally added.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstinate vomitings the operation of internal
medicines may be assisted by aromatic fomentations
made with wine, applied warm to the pit of
the stomach; or the use of the stomach plaster,
with the addition of a little <i>Theriaca</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF A LOOSENESS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A looseness may generally be reckoned salutary
when the stools are sour, slimy, green, or curdled.
It is not the discharge, but the production of such
stools, which ought to be remedied. Even where
the purging is thin and watery, it ought not to be
checked too suddenly, as it often proves critical,
especially when the child has caught cold, or an
eruption on the skin has disappeared. Sometimes
an evacuation of this kind succeeds a humid state
<span class='pageno' id='Page_553'>553</span>of the atmosphere, in which case it may also prove
of advantage, by carrying off a quantity of watery
humours, which would otherwise tend to relax the
habit.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the principal intention of the cure of a looseness
is to evacuate the offending matter, it is customary
to give the patient a gentle vomit of ipecacuanha,
and afterwards to exhibit small and frequent
doses of rhubarb; interposing absorbent medicines,
to mitigate the acrimony of the humours.
The best purge, however, in this case, is <i>magnesia
alba</i>. It is at the same time absorbent and laxative,
and operates without exciting gripes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The antimonial wine, which acts both as an
emetic and purge, is also an excellent medicine in
this case. By being diluted with water, it may be
proportioned to the weakest constitution; and, not
being disagreeable to the palate, it may be repeated
as often as occasion requires. Even one
dose will frequently mitigate the disease, and pave
the way for the use of absorbents. If, however,
the patient’s strength will permit, the medicine
ought to be repeated every six or eight hours, till
the stools begin to assume a more natural appearance;
afterwards a longer space may be allowed to
intervene between the doses. When it is necessary
to repeat the medicine frequently, the dose ought
always to be a little increased, as its efficacy is generally
diminished by use.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some, upon the first appearance of a looseness,
fly immediately to the use of absorbent medicines
and astringents. If these be administered before
the offending humours are discharged, though the
disease may appear to be mitigated for a little time,
it soon afterwards breaks forth with greater violence,
and often proves fatal. After proper evacuations,
however, these medicines may be administered with
considerable advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_554'>554</span>Should any gripings or restlessness remain after
the stomach and bowels have been cleansed, a tea-spoonful
of the syrup of poppies may be given in
a little simple cinnamon-water, three or four times
a-day till these symptoms have ceased.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF ERUPTIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Children, while on the breast, are seldom free
from eruptions of one kind or other. These, however,
are not often dangerous, and ought never to
be dried up but with the greatest caution. They
tend to free the bodies of infants from hurtful humours,
which, if retained, might produce fatal
disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'>The eruptions of children are chiefly owing to
improper food and neglect of cleanliness. If a
child be stuffed at all hours with food that its stomach
is not able to digest, such food, not being
properly assimilated, instead of nourishing the body,
fills it with gross humours. These must either
break out in form of eruptions upon the skin, or
remain in the body, and occasion fevers and other
internal disorders. That neglect of cleanliness is a
very general cause of eruptive disorders, must be
obvious to every one. The children of the poor,
and of all who despise cleanliness, are almost constantly
found to swarm with vermin, and are
generally covered with the scab, itch, and other
eruptions.</p>

<p class='c008'>When eruptions are the effect of improper food,
or want of cleanliness, a proper attention to these
alone will generally be sufficient to remove them.
If this should not be the case, some drying medicines
will be necessary. When they are applied,
the body ought at the same time to be kept open,
and cold is carefully to be avoided. We know no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_555'>555</span>medicine that is more safe for drying up cutaneous
eruptions than sulphur, provided it be prudently
used. A little of the flour of sulphur may be mixed
with fresh butter, oil, or hog’s lard, and the parts
affected frequently touched with it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most obstinate of all the eruptions incident
to children are, the <i>tinea capitis</i>, or scabbed head,
and chilblains. The scabbed head is often exceeding
difficult to cure, and sometimes indeed the
cure proves worse than the disease. I have frequently
known children seized with internal disorders,
of which they died soon after their scabbed
heads had been healed by the application of drying
medicines<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c010'><sup>[190]</sup></a>. The cure ought always first to be attempted
by keeping the head very clean, cutting
off the hair, combing and brushing away the scabs,
&#38;c. If this is not sufficient, let the head be
shaved once a-week, washed daily with soap suds,
and gently anointed with a liniment made of train
oil eight ounces, red precipitate, in fine powder,
one drachm. And if there be proud flesh, it should
be touched with a bit of blue vitriol, sprinkled
with a little burnt allum. While these things are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_556'>556</span>doing, the patient must be confined to a regular
light diet, the body should be kept gently open;
and cold, as far as possible, ought to be avoided.
To prevent any bad consequences from stopping this
discharge, it will be proper, especially in children
of a gross habit, to make an issue in the neck or
arm, which may be kept open till the patient becomes
more strong, and the constitution be somewhat
mended.</p>

<p class='c008'>Chilblains commonly attack children in cold
weather. They are generally occasioned by the feet
or hands being kept long wet or cold, and afterwards
suddenly heated. When children are cold,
instead of taking exercise to warm themselves gradually,
they run to the fire. This occasions a sudden
rarefaction of the humours, and an infarction
of the vessels; which being often repeated, the
vessels are at last over-distended, and forced to
give way.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent it, violent cold and sudden heat must
be equally avoided. When the parts begin to look
red and swell, the patient ought to be purged, and
to have the affected parts frequently rubbed with
mustard and brandy, or something of a warming nature.
They ought likewise to be covered with flannel,
and kept warm and dry. Some apply warm
ashes between cloths to the swelled parts, which
frequently help to reduce them. When there is a
sore, it must be dressed with Turner’s cerate, the
ointment of tutty, the plaster of cerus, or some
other drying ointment. These sores are indeed
troublesome, but seldom dangerous. They generally
heal as soon as the warm weather sets in.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_557'>557</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF THE CROUP.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Children are often seized very suddenly with this
disease, which, if not quickly relieved, proves mortal.
It is known by various names in different
parts of Britain. On the east coast of Scotland it
is called the <i>croup</i>. On the west they call it the
<i>chock</i> or <i>stuffing</i>. In some parts of England, where
I have observed it, the good women call it <i>the
rising of the lights</i>. It seems to be a species of <i>asthma</i>,
attended with very acute and violent catarrhal
symptoms.</p>

<p class='c008'>This disease generally prevails in cold and wet
seasons. It is most common upon the sea-coast,
and in low marshy countries. Children of a gross
and lax habit are most liable to it. I have sometimes
known it hereditary. It generally attacks
children in the night, after having been much exposed
to damp cold easterly winds through the day.
Damp houses, wet feet, thin shoes, wet clothes, or
any thing that obstructs the perspiration, may occasion
the croup.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is attended with a frequent pulse, quick and
laborious breathing, which is performed with a peculiar
kind of croaking noise, that may be heard
at a considerable distance. The voice is sharp and
shrill, and the face is generally much flushed, though
sometimes it is of a livid colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a child is seized with the above symptoms,
his feet should immediately be put into warm
water. He ought likewise to be bled<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c010'><sup>[191]</sup></a>, and to
have a laxative clyster administered as soon as possible.
He should be made to breathe over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_558'>558</span>steams of warm water and vinegar; or an emollient
decoction, and emollient cataplasms or fomentations
may be applied round his neck. If the
symptoms do not abate, a blistering plaster must be
applied round the neck, or between the shoulders,
and the child may take frequently a table-spoonful
of the following julep: Take penny-royal water
three ounces, syrup of althea and balsamic syrup,
each one ounce, mix them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Asafœtida is found to have a good effect in this
case. It may be both given in form of clyster,
and taken by the mouth. Two drachms of asafœtida
may be dissolved in one ounce of Mindererus’s
spirit, and three ounces of penny-royal water.
A table-spoonful of this mixture may be
given every hour, or oftner, if the patient’s stomach
be able to bear it. If the child cannot be
brought to take this medicine, two drachms of the
asafœtida may be dissolved in a common clyster, and
administered every six or eight hours, till the violence
of the disease abates<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c010'><sup>[192]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>To prevent a return of the disorder, all those
things which occasion it must be carefully avoided;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_559'>559</span>as wet feet, cold, damp, easterly winds, &#38;c. Children
who have had frequent returns of this disease,
or whose constitutions seem to dispose them to it,
ought to have their diet properly regulated; all
food that is viscid or hard of digestion, and all
crude, raw, trashy fruits, are to be avoided. They
ought likewise to have a drain constantly kept open
in some part of their body, by means of a seton or
issue. I have sometimes known a Burgundy-pitch
plaster, worn continually between the shoulders for
several years, have a very happy effect in preventing
the return of this dreadful disorder.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF TEETHING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Dr. Arbuthnot observes, that above a tenth part
of infants die in teething, by symptoms proceeding
from the irritation of the tender nervous parts of
the jaws, occasioning inflammations, fevers, convulsions,
gangrenes, &#38;c. These symptoms are in
a great measure owing to the great delicacy and
exquisite sensibility of the nervous system at this
time of life, which is too often increased by an effeminate
education. Hence it comes to pass, that
children who are delicately brought up, always
suffer most in teething, and often fall by convulsive
disorders.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the sixth or seventh month the teeth generally
begin to make their appearance; first, the
<i>incisores</i>, or fore-teeth; next, the <i>canini</i>, or dogteeth;
and, lastly, the <i>molares</i>, or grinders. About
the seventh year, there comes a new set; and about
the twentieth, the two inner grinders, called <i>dentes
sapientiæ</i>, the teeth of wisdom.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children, about the time of cutting their teeth,
slaver much, and have generally a looseness. When
the teething is difficult, especially when the dogteeth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_560'>560</span>begin to make their way through the gums,
the child has startings in his sleep, tumours of the
gums, watchings, gripes, green stools, the thrush,
fever, difficult breathing, and convulsions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Difficult teething requires nearly the same treatment
as an inflammatory disease. If the body be
bound, it must be opened either by emollient clysters
or gentle purgatives; as manna, <i>magnesia alba</i>,
rhubarb, senna, or the like. The food should be
light, and in small quantity; the drink plentiful,
but weak and diluting, as infusions of balm, or
of the lime-tree flowers; to which about a third or
fourth part of milk may be added.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the fever be high, bleeding will be necessary;
but this in very young children ought always to be
sparingly performed. It is an evacuation which
they bear the worst of any. Purging, vomiting,
or sweating, agree much better with them, and are
generally more beneficial. Harris, however, observes,
that, when an inflammation appears, the
physician will labour in vain, if the <i>cure</i> be not begun
with applying a leech under each ear. If the
child be seized with convulsion-fits, a blistering-plaster
may be applied between the shoulders, or
one behind each ear.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sydenham says, that in fevers occasioned by
teething, he never found any remedy so effectual
as two, three, or four drops of spirits of hartshorn
in a spoonful of simple water, or other convenient
vehicle, given every four hours. The number of
doses may be four, five, or six. I have often prescribed
this medicine with success, but always found
a larger dose necessary. It may be given from five
drops to fifteen or twenty, according to the age of
the child, and, when costiveness does not forbid it,
three or four drops of laudanum may be added to
each dose.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_561'>561</span>In Scotland, it is very common, when children
are cutting their teeth, to put a small Burgundy-pitch
plaster between their shoulders. This generally
eases the tickling cough which attends teething, and
is by no means an useless application. When the
teeth are cut with difficulty, it ought to be kept
on during the whole time of teething. It may be
enlarged as occasion requires, and ought to be renewed
at least once a fortnight.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several things have been recommended for rubbing
the gums, as oils, mucilages, &#38;c.; but from
these much is not to be expected. If any thing of
this kind is to be used, we would recommend a
little fine honey, which may be rubbed on with the
finger three or four times a-day. Children are generally
at this time disposed to chew whatever they
get into their hands. For this reason they ought
never to be without somewhat that will yield a little
to the pressure of their gums, as a crust of bread,
a wax-candle, a bit of liquorice-root, or such
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to cutting the gums, we have seldom
known it of any great benefit. In obstinate
cases, however, it ought to be tried. It may be
performed by the finger-nail, the edge of a six-penny
piece that is worn thin, or any sharp body
which can be with safety introduced into the mouth;
but the lancet, in a skilful hand, is certainly the
most proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>In order to render the teething less difficult, parents
ought to take care that their children’s food
be light and wholesome, and that their nerves be
braced by sufficient exercise without doors, the use
of the cold bath, &#38;c. Were these things duly regarded,
they would have a much better effect than
<i>teething necklaces</i>, or other nonsensical amulets worn
for that purpose.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_562'>562</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF THE RICKETS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>This disease generally attacks children between
the age of nine months and two years. It appeared
first in England about the time when manufactures
began to flourish, and still prevails most in towns
where the inhabitants follow sedentary employments,
by which means they neglect either to take
proper exercise themselves, or to give it to their
children.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——One cause of the rickets is diseased
parents. Mothers of a weak relaxed habit,
who neglect exercise, and live upon weak watery
diet, can neither be expected to bring forth strong
and healthy children, or to be able to nurse them,
after they are brought forth. Accordingly we find,
that the children of such women generally die of
the rickets, the scrophula, consumptions, or such
like diseases. Children begotten by men in the
decline of life, who are subject to the gout, the
gravel, or other chronic diseases, or who have been
often affected with the venereal disease in their
youth, are likewise very liable to the rickets.</p>

<p class='c008'>Any disorder that weakens the constitution, or
relaxes the habit of children, as the small-pox,
measles, teething, the hooping-cough, &#38;c. disposes
them to this disease. It may likewise be occasioned
by improper diet, as food that is either
too weak and watery, or so viscid that the stomach
cannot digest it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bad nursing is the chief cause of this disease.
When the nurse is either diseased, or has not enough
of milk to nourish the child, it cannot thrive. But
children suffer oftner by want of care in nurses than
want of food. Allowing an infant to lie or sit too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_563'>563</span>much, or not keeping it thoroughly clean in its
clothes, has the most pernicious effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>The want of free air is likewise very hurtful to
children in this respect. When a nurse lives in a
close small house, where the air is damp and confined,
and is too indolent to carry her child abroad
into the open air, it will hardly escape this disease.
A healthy child should always be in motion, unless
when asleep; if it be suffered to lie, or sit,
instead of being tossed and dandled about, it will
not thrive.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——At the beginning of this disease
the child’s flesh grows soft and flabby; its
strength is diminished; it loses its wonted cheerfulness,
looks more grave and composed than is
natural for its age, and does not chuse to be moved.
The head and belly become too large in proportion
to the other parts; the face appears full, and
the complexion florid. Afterwards the bones begin
to be affected, especially in the more soft and
spungy parts. Hence the wrists and ancles become
thicker than usual; the spine or backbone puts on
an unnatural shape; the breast is likewise often deformed;
and the bones of the arms and legs grow
crooked. All these symptoms vary according to
the violence of the disease. The pulse is generally
quick, but feeble; the appetite and digestion for
the most part bad; the teeth come slowly and with
difficulty, and they often rot and fall out afterwards.
Ricketty children generally have great
acuteness of mind, and an understanding above
their years. Whether this is owing to their being
more in the company of adults than other children,
or to the preternatural enlargement of the brain, is
not material.</p>

<p class='c008'>REGIMEN.——As this disease is always attended
with evident signs of weakness and relaxation,
our chief aim in the cure must be to brace
<span class='pageno' id='Page_564'>564</span>and strengthen the solids, and to promote digestion
and the due preparation of the fluids. These
important ends will be best answered by wholesome
nourishing diet, suited to the age and strength of
the patient, open dry air, and sufficient exercise.
If the child has a bad nurse, who either neglects
her duty, or does not understand it, she should be
changed. If the season be cold, the child ought
to be kept warm; and when the weather is hot,
it ought to be kept cool; as sweating is apt to
weaken it, and too great a degree of cold has the
same effect. The limbs should be rubbed frequently
with a warm hand, and the child kept as
cheerful as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>The diet ought to be dry and nourishing, as
good bread, roasted flesh, &#38;c. Biscuit is generally
reckoned the best bread; and pigeons, pullets,
veal, rabbits, or mutton roasted or minced,
are the most proper flesh. If the child be too
young for flesh-meats, he may have rice, millet,
or pearl-barley boiled with raisins, to which may
be added a little wine and spice. His drink may
be good claret, mixed with an equal quantity of
water. Those who cannot afford claret, may give
the child now and then a wine-glass of mild ale,
or good porter.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——Medicines are here of little
avail. The disease may often be cured by the
nurse, but seldom by the physician. In children
of a gross habit, gentle vomits and repeated purges
of rhubarb may sometimes be of use, but they will
seldom carry off the disease; that must depend
chiefly upon such things as brace and strengthen the
system: for which purpose, besides the regimen
mentioned above, we would recommend the cold
bath, especially in the warm season. It must however
be used with prudence, as some ricketty children
cannot bear it. The best time for using the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_565'>565</span>cold bath is in the morning, and the child should
be well rubbed with a dry cloth immediately after he
comes out of it. If the child should be weakened
by the cold bath, it must be discontinued.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sometimes issues have been found beneficial in
this disease. They are peculiarly necessary for children
who abound with gross humours. An infusion
of the Peruvian bark in wine or ale would be of
service, were it possible to bring children to take
it. We might here mention many other medicines
which have been recommended for the rickets; but
as there is far more danger in trusting to these than
in neglecting them altogether, we chuse rather to
pass them over, and to recommend a proper regimen
as the thing chiefly to be depended on.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF CONVULSIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though more children are said to die of convulsions
than of any other disease, yet they are for the
most part only a symptom of some other malady.
Whatever greatly irritates or stimulates the nerves,
may occasion convulsions. Hence infants whose
nerves are easily affected, are often thrown into
convulsions by any thing that irritates the alimentary
canal; likewise by teething; strait clothes;
the approach of the small-pox, measles, or other
eruptive diseases.</p>

<p class='c008'>When convulsions proceed from an irritation of
the stomach or bowels, whatever clears them of
their acrid contents, or renders these mild and inoffensive,
will generally perform a cure: wherefore,
if the child be costive, the best way will be
to begin with a clyster, and afterwards to give a
gentle vomit, which may be repeated occasionally,
and the body in the mean time kept open by gentle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_566'>566</span>doses of <i>magnesia alba</i>, or small quantities of rhubarb
mixed with the powder of crabs claws.</p>

<p class='c008'>Convulsions which precede the eruption of the
small-pox or measles generally go off upon these
making their appearance. The principal danger
in this case arises from the fears and apprehensions
of those who have the care of the patient. Convulsions
are very alarming, and something must be
done to appease the affrighted parents, nurses, &#38;c.
Hence the unhappy infant often undergoes bleeding,
blistering, and several other operations, to the
great danger of its life, when a little time, bathing
the feet in warm water, and throwing in a mild
clyster, would have set all to rights.</p>

<p class='c008'>When convulsion fits arise from the cutting of
teeth, besides gentle evacuations, we would recommend
blistering, and the use of antispasmodic medicines,
as the tincture of soot, asafœtida, or castor.
A few drops of any of these may be mixed in a cup
of white-wine whey, and given occasionally.</p>

<p class='c008'>When convulsions proceed from any external
cause, as the pressure occasioned by strait clothes
or bandages, &#38;c. these ought immediately to be
removed; though in this case taking away the
cause will not always remove the effect, yet it
ought to be done. It is not likely that the patient
will recover, as long as the cause which first gave
rise to the disorder continues to act.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a child is seized with convulsions without
having any complaint in the bowels, or symptoms
of teething; or any rash or other discharge which
has been suddenly dried up; we have reason to conclude
that it is a primary disease, and proceeds immediately
from the brain. Cases of this kind,
however, happen but seldom, which is very fortunate,
as little can be done to relieve the unhappy
patient. When a disease proceeds from an origial
<span class='pageno' id='Page_567'>567</span>fault in the formation or structure of the brain
itself, we cannot expect that it should yield to medicine.
But as this is not always the cause, even
of convulsions which proceed immediately from
the brain, some attempts should be made to remove
them. The chief intention to be pursued
for this purpose, is to make some derivation from
the head, by blistering, purging, and the like.
Should these fail, issues or setons may be put in
the neck, or between the shoulders.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF WATER IN THE HEAD.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though water in the head, or a dropsy of the
brain, may affect adults as well as children, yet, as
the latter are more peculiarly liable to it, we
thought it would be most proper to place it among
the diseases of infants.</p>

<p class='c008'>CAUSES.——A dropsy of the brain may proceed
from injuries done to the brain itself by falls,
blows, or the like; it may likewise proceed from
an original laxity or weakness of the brain; from
scirrhous tumours or excrescences within the skull;
a thin watery state of the blood; a diminished
secretion of urine; and, lastly, from tedious and
lingering diseases, which waste and consume the
patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>SYMPTOMS.——This disease has at first the
appearance of a slow fever; the patient complains
of a pain in the crown of his head, or over his eyes;
he shuns the light; is sick, and sometimes vomits;
his pulse is irregular and generally low: though he
seems heavy and dull, yet he does not sleep: he is
sometimes delirious, and frequently sees objects
double; towards the end of this commonly fatal
disease, the pulse becomes more frequent, the pupils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_568'>568</span>are generally dilated, the cheeks flushed, the
patient becomes comatose, and convulsions ensue.</p>

<p class='c008'>MEDICINE.——No medicine has hitherto been
found sufficient to carry off a dropsy of the brain.
It is laudable, however, to make some attempts,
as time or chance may bring many things to light,
of which at present we have no idea. The medicines
generally used are, purges of rhubarb or jalap
with calomel, and blistering-plasters applied to
the neck or back part of the head. To which we
would beg leave to add diuretics, or medicines
which promote the secretion of urine, such as are
recommended in the common dropsy. A discharge
from the nose ought likewise to be promoted by
causing the patient to snuff the powder of asarum,
white hellebore, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some practitioners have of late pretended to cure
this disease by the use of mercury. I have not
been so happy as to see any instances of a cure being
performed in a confirmed dropsy of the brain; but
in so desperate a malady every thing deserves a trial<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c010'><sup>[193]</sup></a>.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_569'>569</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAP. L.<br> <span class='c015'>OF SURGERY.</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>To describe all the operations of surgery, and
to point out the different diseases in which
these operations are necessary, would extend this
article far beyond the limits allotted to it: we must
therefore confine our observations to such cases as
most generally occur, and in which proper assistance
is either not asked, or not always to be obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though an acquaintance with the structure of
the human body is indispensably necessary to qualify
a man for being an expert surgeon; yet many
things may be done to save the lives of their fellow-men
in emergencies by those who are no adepts in
anatomy. It is amazing with what facility the
peasants daily perform operations upon brute animals,
which are not of a less difficult nature than
many of those performed on the human species;
yet they seldom fail of success.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed every man is in some measure a surgeon
whether he will or not. He feels an inclination to
assist his fellow-men in distress, and accidents happen
every hour which give occasion to exercise this
feeling. The feelings of the heart, however, when
not directed by the judgment, are apt to mislead.
Thus one, by a rash attempt to save his friend,
may sometimes destroy him; while another, for
fear of doing amiss, stands still and sees his bosom-friend
expire without so much as attempting to relieve
him, even when the means are in his power.
As every good man would wish to steer a course
different from either of these, it will no doubt be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_570'>570</span>agreeable to him to know what ought to be done
upon such emergencies.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF BLEEDING.</h4>

<p class='c018'>No operation of surgery is so frequently necessary
as bleeding; it ought therefore to be very generally
understood. But though practised by midwives,
gardeners, blacksmiths, we have reason
to believe that very few know when it is proper.
Even physicians themselves have been so much the
dupes of theory in this article, as to render it the
subject of ridicule. It is however an operation of
great importance, and must, when seasonably and
properly performed, be of singular service to those
in distress.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bleeding is proper at the beginning of all inflammatory
fevers, as pleurisies, peripneumonies,
&#38;c. It is likewise proper in all topical inflammations,
as those of the intestines, womb, bladder,
stomach, kidnies, throat, eyes, &#38;c. as also in the
asthma, sciatic pains, coughs, head-achs, rheumatisms,
the apoplexy, epilepsy, and bloody flux.
After falls, blows, bruises, or any violent hurt received
either externally or internally, bleeding is
necessary. It is likewise necessary for persons who
have had the misfortune to be strangled, drowned,
suffocated with foul air, the fumes of metal, or the
like. In a word, whenever the vital motions have
been suddenly stopt from any cause whatever, except
in swoonings occasioned by mere weakness or hysteric
affections, it is proper to open a vein. But
in all disorders proceeding from a relaxation of
the solids, and an impoverished state of the blood,
as dropsies, cacochymies, &#38;c. bleeding is improper.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_571'>571</span>Bleeding for topical inflammations ought always
to be performed as near the part affected as possible.
When this can be done with a lancet, it is
to be preferred to any other method; but where a
vein cannot be found, recourse must be had to
leeches or cupping.</p>

<p class='c008'>The quantity of blood to be let must always be
regulated by the strength, age, constitution, manner
of life, and other circumstances relating to the
patient. It would be ridiculous to suppose that a
child could bear to lose as much blood as a grown
person, or that a delicate lady should be bled to
the same extent as a robust man.</p>

<p class='c008'>From whatever part of the body blood is to be
let, a bandage must be applied between that part
and the heart. As it is often necessary, in order to
raise the vein, to make the bandage pretty tight, it
will be proper in such cases, as soon as the blood
begins to flow, to slacken it a little. The bandage
ought to be applied at least an inch, or an inch
and half from the place where the wound is intended
to be made.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons not skilled in anatomy ought never to
bleed in a vein that lies over an artery or a tendon,
if they can avoid it. The former may easily be
known from its pulsation or beating, and the latter
from its feeling hard or tight like a whipcord under
the finger.</p>

<p class='c008'>It was formerly a rule, even among those who
had the character of being regular practitioners, to
bleed their patients in certain diseases till they
fainted. Surely a more ridiculous rule could not
be proposed. One person will faint at the very
sight of a lancet, while another will lose almost the
whole blood of his body before he faints. Swooning
depends more upon the state of the mind than
of the body; besides, it may often be occasioned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_572'>572</span>or prevented by the manner in which the operation
is performed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Children are generally bled with leeches. This,
though sometimes necessary, is a very troublesome
and uncertain practice. It is impossible to know
what quantity of blood is taken away by leeches;
besides, the bleeding is often very difficult to stop,
and the wounds are not easily healed. Would those
who practice bleeding take a little more pains,
and accustom themselves to bleed children, they
would not find it such a difficult operation as they
imagine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Certain hurtful prejudices with regard to bleeding
still prevail among the country people. They
talk, for instance, of head-veins, heart-veins,
breast-veins, &#38;c. and believe that bleeding in these
will certainly cure all diseases of the parts from
whence they are supposed to come, without considering
that all the blood-vessels arise from the
heart, and return to it again; for which reason, unless
in topical inflammations, it signifies very little
from what part of the body blood is taken. But
this, though a foolish prejudice, is not near so
hurtful as the vulgar notion that the first bleeding
will perform wonders. This belief makes them
often postpone the operation when necessary, in order
to reserve it for some more important occasion,
and, when they think themselves in extreme danger,
they fly to it for relief, whether it be proper
or not. Bleeding at certain dated periods or seasons
has likewise bad effects.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a common notion that bleeding in the
feet draws the humours downwards, and consequently
cures diseases of the head and other superior
parts: but we have already observed that,
in all topical affections, the blood ought to be
drawn as near the part as possible. When it is
necessary, however, to bleed in the foot or hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_573'>573</span>as the veins are small, and the bleeding is apt to
stop too soon, the part ought to be immersed in
warm water, and kept there till a sufficient quantity
of blood be let.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall not spend time in describing the manner
of performing this operation: that will be better
learned by example than precept. Twenty pages
of description would not convey so just an idea of
the operation as seeing it once performed by an expert
hand. Neither is it necessary to point out the
different parts of the body from whence blood may
be taken, as the arm, foot, forehead, temples, neck,
&#38;c. These will readily occur to every intelligent
person, and the foregoing observations will be sufficient
for determining which of them is most proper
upon any particular occasion. In all cases
where the intention is merely to lessen the general
mass of blood, the arm is the most commodious
part of the body in which the operation can be performed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF INFLAMMATIONS AND ABSCESSES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>From whatever cause an inflammation proceeds,
it must terminate either by dispersion, suppuration,
or gangrene. Though it is impossible to foretel
with certainty in which of these ways any particular
inflammation will terminate, yet a probable conjecture
may be formed with regard to the event,
from a knowledge of the patient’s age and constitution.
Inflammations happening in a slight degree
upon colds, and without any previous indisposition,
will most probably be dispersed; those
which follow close upon a fever, or happen to persons
of a gross habit of body, will generally suppurate;
and those which attack very old people, or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_574'>574</span>persons of a dropsical habit, will have a strong tendency
to gangrene.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the inflammation be slight, and the constitution
sound, the dispersion ought always to be attempted.
This will be best promoted by a slender
diluting diet, plentiful bleeding, and repeated
purges. The part itself must be fomented, and, if
the skin be very tense, it may be embrocated with
a mixture of three-fourths of sweet oil, and one-fourth
of vinegar, and afterwards covered with a
piece of wax plaster.</p>

<p class='c008'>If, notwithstanding these applications, the symptomatic
fever increases, and the tumour becomes
larger, with violent pain and pulsation, it will be
proper to promote the suppuration. The best application
for this purpose is a soft poultice, which
may be renewed twice a day. If the suppuration
proceeds but slowly, a raw onion cut small or
bruised may be spread upon the poultice. When
the abscess is ripe or fit for opening, which may
easily be known from the thinness of the skin in
the most prominent part of it, a fluctuation of matter
which may be felt under the finger, and, generally
speaking, an abatement of the pain, it may
be opened either with a lancet or by means of
caustic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The last way in which an inflammation terminates,
is in a gangrene or mortification, the approach
of which may be known by the following
symptoms: the inflammation loses its redness, and
becomes duskish or livid; the tension of the
skin goes off, and it feels flabby; little bladders
filled with ichor of different colours spread all over
it; the tumour subsides, and from a duskish complexion
becomes black; a quick low pulse, with
cold clammy sweats, are the immediate forerunners
of death.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_575'>575</span>When these symptoms first appear, the part
ought to be dressed with London treacle, or a
cataplasm made of lixivium and bran. Should the
symptoms become worse, the part must be scarified,
and afterwards dressed with basilicum softened
with oil of turpentine. All the dressings must be
applied warm. With regard to internal medicines,
the patient must be supported with generous cordials,
and the Peruvian bark exhibited in as large
doses as the stomach will bear it. If the mortified
parts should separate, the wound will become a
common ulcer, and must be treated accordingly.</p>

<p class='c008'>This article includes the treatment of all those
diseases, which, in different parts of the country,
go by the names of <i>biles</i>, <i>imposthumes</i>, <i>whitloes</i>,
&#38;c. They are all abscesses in consequence of a
previous inflammation, which, if possible, ought
to be discussed; but when this cannot be done, the
suppuration should be promoted, and the matter
discharged by an incision, if necessary; afterwards
the sore may be dressed with yellow basilicum, or
some other digestive ointment.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF WOUNDS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>No part of medicine has been more mistaken
than the treatment or cure of wounds. Mankind
in general believe that certain herbs, ointments,
and plasters are possessed of wonderful healing
powers, and imagine that no wound can be cured
without the application of them. It is however a
fact, that no external application whatever contributes
towards the cure of a wound, any other way
than by keeping the parts soft, clean, and defending
them from the external air, which may be as
effectually done by dry lint, as by the most pompous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_576'>576</span>applications, while it is exempt from many of
the bad consequences attending them.</p>

<p class='c008'>The same observation holds with respect to internal
applications. These only promote the cure
of wounds as far as they tend to prevent a fever, or
to remove any cause that might obstruct or impede
the operations of Nature. It is Nature alone that
cures wounds. All that Art can do is to remove
obstacles, and to put the parts in such a condition
as is the most favourable to Nature’s efforts.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this simple view we shall consider the treatment
of wounds, and endeavour to point out
such steps as ought to be taken to facilitate their
cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first thing to be done when a person has received
a wound, is to examine whether any foreign
body be lodged in it, as wood, stone, iron, lead,
glass, dirt, bits of cloth, or the like. These, if
possible, ought to be extracted, and the wound
cleaned, before any dressings be applied. When
that cannot be effected with safety, on account of
the patient’s weakness, or loss of blood, they must
be suffered to remain in the wound, and afterwards
extracted when he is more able to bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a wound penetrates into any of the cavities
of the body, as the breast, the bowels, &#38;c.
or where any considerable blood-vessel is cut, a
skilful surgeon ought immediately to be called,
otherwise the patient may lose his life. But sometimes
the discharge of blood is so great, that if it
be not stopt, the patient may die even before a
surgeon, though at no great distance, can arrive.
In this case, something must be done by those who
are present. If the wound be in any of the limbs,
the bleeding may generally be stopt by applying a
tight ligature or bandage round the member a little
above the wound. The best method of doing this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_577'>577</span>is to put a strong broad garter round the part, but
so slack as easily to admit a small piece of stick to
be put under it, which must be twisted, in the
same manner as a countryman does a cart-rope to
secure his loading, till the bleeding stops. Whenever
this is the case, he must take care to twist it
no longer, as straining it too much might occasion
an inflammation of the parts, and endanger a gangrene.</p>

<p class='c008'>In parts where this bandage cannot be applied,
various other methods may be tried to stop the
bleeding, as the application of styptics, astringents,
&#38;c. Cloths dipped in a solution of blue vitriol in
water, or the <i>styptic water</i> of the Dispensatories,
may be applied to the wound. When these cannot
be obtained, strong spirits of wine may be
used. Some recommend the <i>agaric</i><a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c010'><sup>[194]</sup></a> of the oak
as preferable to any of the other styptics; and indeed
it deserves considerable encomiums. It is
easily obtained, and ought to be kept in every family,
in case of accidents. A piece of it must
be laid upon the wound, and covered with a good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_578'>578</span>deal of lint, above which a bandage may be applied
so tight as to keep it firmly on.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though spirits, tinctures, and hot balsams may
be used, in order to stop the bleeding when it is
excessive, they are improper at other times. They
do not promote but retard the cure, and often
change a simple wound into an ulcer. People imagine,
because hot balsams congeal the blood, and
seem, as it were, to solder up the wound, that they
therefore heal it; but this is only a deception.
They may indeed stop the flowing blood, by searing
the mouths of the vessels; but, by rendering
the parts callous, they obstruct the cure.</p>

<p class='c008'>In slight wounds, which do not penetrate much
deeper than the skin, the best application is a bit
of the common black sticking-plaster. This keeps
the sides of the wound together, and prevents the
air from hurting it, which is all that is necessary.
When a wound penetrates deep, it is not safe to
keep its lips quite close: this keeps in the matter,
and is apt to make the wound fester. In this case
the best way is to fill the wound with soft lint, commonly
called <i>caddis</i>. It however must not be stuffed
in too hard, otherwise it will do hurt. The
lint may be covered with a cloth dipped in oil,
or spread with the common wax plaster<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c010'><sup>[195]</sup></a>; and the
whole must be kept on by a proper bandage.</p>

<p class='c008'>We shall not spend time in describing the different
bandages that may be proper for wounds in
different parts of the body; common sense will
generally suggest the most commodious method of
applying a bandage; besides, descriptions of this
kind are not easily understood or remembered.</p>

<p class='c008'>The first dressing ought to continue on for at
least two days; after which it may be removed,
and fresh lint applied as before. If any part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_579'>579</span>the first dressing sticks so close as not to be removed
with ease or safety to the patient, it may be
allowed to continue, and fresh lint dipped in sweet
oil laid over it. This will soften it, so as to make
it come off easily at next dressing. Afterwards the
wound may be dressed twice a-day in the same manner
till it be quite healed. Those who are fond of
salves or ointments, may, after the wound is become
very superficial, dress it with the yellow <i>basilicum</i><a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c010'><sup>[196]</sup></a>;
and if fungous, or what is called <i>proud
flesh</i>, should rise in the wound, it may be checked,
by mixing with the ointment a little burnt alum or
red precipitate of mercury.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a wound is greatly inflamed, the most proper
application is a poultice of bread and milk,
softened with a little sweet oil or fresh butter.
This must be applied instead of a plaster, and
should be changed twice a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the wound be large, and there is reason to
fear an inflammation, the patient should be kept on
a very low diet. He must abstain from flesh,
strong liquors, and every thing that is of a heating
nature. If he be of a full habit, and has lost but
little blood from the wound, he must be bled; and,
if the symptoms be urgent, the operation may be
repeated. But when the patient has been greatly
weakened by loss of blood from the wound, it will
be dangerous to bleed him, even though a fever
should ensue. Nature should never be too far exhausted.
It is always more safe to allow her to
struggle with the disease in her own way, than to
sink the patient’s strength by excessive evacuations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wounded persons ought to be kept perfectly
quiet and easy. Every thing that ruffles the mind
or moves the passions, as love, anger, fear, excessive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_580'>580</span>joy, &#38;c. are very hurtful. They ought above all
things to abstain from venery. The body should
be kept gently open, either by laxative clysters, or
by a cool vegetable diet, as roasted apples, stewed
prunes, boiled spinage, and such like.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF BURNS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>In slight burns which do not break the skin, it is
customary to hold the part near the fire for a competent
time, to rub it with salt, or to lay a compress
upon it dipped in spirits of wine or brandy.
But when the burn has penetrated so deep as to
blister or break the skin, it must be dressed with
some of the liniment for burns mentioned in the
Appendix, or with the emollient and gently drying
ointment, commonly called <i>Turner’s cerate</i><a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c010'><sup>[197]</sup></a>. This
may be mixed with an equal quantity of fresh olive
oil, and spread upon a soft rag, and applied to the
part affected. When this ointment cannot be had,
an egg may be beat up with about an equal quantity
of the sweetest salad-oil. This will serve very
well till a proper ointment can be prepared. When
the burning is very deep, after the first two or three
days, it should be dressed with equal parts of yellow
<i>basilicum</i> and <i>Turner’s cerate</i> mixed together.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the burn is violent, or has occasioned a
high degree of inflammation, and there is reason to
fear a gangrene or mortification, the same means
must be used to prevent it as are recommended in
other violent inflammations. The patient, in this
case, must live low, and drink freely of weak diluting
liquors. He must likewise be bled, and
have his body kept open. But if the burnt parts
should become livid or black, with other symptoms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_581'>581</span>of mortification, it will be necessary to bathe
them frequently with warm camphorated spirits of
wine, tincture of myrrh, or other antiseptics, mixed
with a decoction of the bark. In this case the bark
must likewise be taken internally, and the patient’s
diet must be more generous.</p>

<p class='c008'>As example teaches better than precept, I shall
relate the treatment of the most dreadful case of
this kind that has occurred in my practice. A
middle-aged man, of a good constitution, fell into
a large vessel full of boiling water, and miserably
scalded about one half of his body. As his clothes
were on, the burning in some parts was very deep
before they could be got off. For the first two
days the scalded parts had been frequently anointed
with a mixture of lime-water and oil, which is a
very proper application for recent burnings. On
the third day, when I first saw him, his fever was
high, and his body costive, for which he was bled,
and had an emollient clyster administered. Poultices
of bread and milk, softened with fresh butter,
were likewise applied to the affected parts, to
abate the heat and inflammation. His fever still
continuing high, he was bled a second time, was
kept strictly on the cooling regimen, took the saline
mixture with small doses of nitre, and had an
emollient clyster administered once a-day. When
the inflammation began to abate, the parts were
dressed with a digestive composed of brown cerate and
yellow basilicum. Where any black spots appeared,
they were slightly scarified, and touched with
the tincture of myrrh; and, to prevent their spreading,
the Peruvian bark was administered. By this
course, the man was so well in three weeks as to be
able to attend his business.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_582'>582</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF BRUISES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Bruises are generally productive of worse consequences
than wounds. The danger from them
does not appear immediately, by which means it
often happens that they are neglected. It is needless
to give any definition of a disease so universally
known; we shall therefore proceed to point out
the method of treating it.</p>

<p class='c008'>In slight bruises it will be sufficient to bathe the
part with warm vinegar, to which a little brandy
or rum may occasionally be added, and to keep
cloths wet with this mixture constantly applied to
it. This is more proper than rubbing it with
brandy, spirits of wine, or other ardent spirits,
which are commonly used in such cases.</p>

<p class='c008'>In some parts of the country the peasants apply to
a recent bruise a cataplasm of fresh cow-dung. I
have often seen this cataplasm applied to violent
contusions occasioned by blows, falls, bruises, and
such like, and never knew it fail to have a good
effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a bruise is very violent, the patient ought
immediately to be bled, and put upon a proper regimen.
His food should be light and cool, and his
drink weak, and of an opening nature; as whey
sweetened with honey, decoctions of tamarinds, barley,
cream-tartar-whey, and such like. The bruised
part must be bathed with vinegar and water, as directed
above; and a poultice made by boiling crumb
of bread, elder-flowers, and camomile-flowers, in
equal quantities of vinegar and water, applied to
it. This poultice is peculiarly proper when a
wound is joined to the bruise. It may be renewed
two or three times a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_583'>583</span>As the structure of the vessels is totally destroyed
by a violent bruise, there often ensues a great loss of
substance, which produces an ulcerous sore very
difficult to cure. If the bone be affected, the sore
will not heal before an exfoliation takes place; that
is, before the diseased part of the bone separates,
and comes out through the wound. This is often
a very slow operation, and may even require several
years to be completed. Hence it happens, that
these sores are frequently mistaken for the king’s
evil, and treated as such, though in fact they proceed
solely from the injury which the solid parts
received from the blow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Patients in this situation are pestered with different
advices. Every one who sees them proposes
a new remedy, till the sore is so much irritated with
various and opposite applications, that it is often
at length rendered absolutely incurable. The best
method of managing such sores is, to take care
that the patient’s constitution does not suffer by
confinement, or improper medicine, and to apply
nothing to them besides simple ointment spread
upon soft lint, over which a poultice of bread and
milk, with boiled camomile-flowers, or the like,
may be put, to nourish the part, and keep it soft
and warm. Nature, thus assisted, will generally
in time operate a cure, by throwing off the diseased
parts of the bone, after which the sore soon
heals.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF ULCERS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Ulcers may be the consequence of wounds,
bruises, or imposthumes improperly treated; they
may likewise proceed from an ill state of the humours,
or what may be called a bad habit of
body.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_584'>584</span>In the latter case, they ought not to be hastily
dried up, otherwise it may prove fatal to the patient.
Ulcers happen most commonly in the decline
of life; and persons who neglect exercise,
and live grossly, are most liable to them. They
might often be prevented by retrenching some part
of the solid food, or by opening artificial drains, as
issues, setons, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ulcer may be distinguished from a wound by
its discharging a thin watery humour, which is
often so acrid as to inflame and corrode the skin;
by the hardness and perpendicular situation of its
sides or edges, by the time of its duration, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>It requires considerable skill to be able to judge
whether or not an ulcer ought to be dried up. In
general, all ulcers which proceed from a bad habit
of body, should be suffered to continue open,
at least till the constitution has been so far changed
by proper regimen, or the use of medicine, that
they seem disposed to heal of their own accord.
Ulcers which are the effect of malignant fevers, or
other acute diseases, may generally be healed with
safety after the health has been restored for some
time. The cure ought not however to be attempted
too soon, nor at any time without the use of
purging medicines and a proper regimen. When
wounds or bruises have, by wrong treatment, degenerated
into ulcers, if the constitution be good,
they may generally be healed with safety. When
ulcers either accompany chronical diseases, or
come in their stead, they must be cautiously healed.
If an ulcer conduces to the patient’s health, from
whatever cause it proceeds, it ought not to be
healed; but if, on the contrary, it wastes the
strength, and consumes the patient by a slow fever,
it should be healed as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_585'>585</span>We would earnestly recommend a strict attention
to these particulars, to all who have the misfortune
to labour under this disorder, particularly persons
in the decline of life; as we have frequently known
people throw away their lives by the want of it,
while they were extolling and generously rewarding
those whom they ought to have looked upon as
their executioners.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper regimen for promoting the cure
of ulcers, is to avoid all spices, salted and high-seasoned
food, all strong liquors, and to lessen the
usual quantity of flesh meat. The body ought to
be kept gently open by a diet consisting chiefly of
cooling laxative vegetables, and by drinking butter-milk,
whey sweetened with honey, or the like.
The patient ought to be kept cheerful, and should
take as much exercise as he can easily bear.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the bottom and sides of an ulcer seem
hard and callous, they may be sprinkled twice
a-day with a little red precipitate of mercury,
and afterwards dressed with the yellow <i>basilicum</i>
ointment. Sometimes it will be necessary to have
the edges of the ulcer scarified with the lancet.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lime-water has frequently been known to have
very happy effects in the cure of obstinate ulcers.
It may be used in the same manner as directed for
the stone and gravel.</p>

<p class='c008'>My late learned and ingenious friend, Dr. Whytt,
strongly recommends the use of the solution of corrosive
sublimate of mercury in brandy, for the cure
of obstinate ill conditioned ulcers. I have frequently
found this medicine, when given according
to the Doctor’s directions, prove very successful.
The dose is a table-spoonful night and morning;
at the same time washing the sore twice or
thrice a-day with it. In a letter which I had from
the Doctor a little before his death, he informed
me, “That he observed washing the sore thrice
<span class='pageno' id='Page_586'>586</span>a-day with the solution of a triple strength was very
beneficial<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c010'><sup>[198]</sup></a>.”</p>

<p class='c008'>A fistulous ulcer can seldom be cured without
an operation. It must either be laid open so as to
have its callous parts destroyed by some corrosive
application, or they must be entirely cut away by
the knife: but as this operation requires the hand
of an expert surgeon, there is no occasion to describe
it. Ulcers about the <i>anus</i> are most apt to
become fistulous, and are very difficult to cure.
Some indeed pretend to have found Ward’s Fistula
paste very successful in this complaint. It is not a
dangerous medicine, and being easily procured, it
may deserve a trial; but as these ulcers generally
proceed from an ill habit of body, they will seldom
yield to any thing except a long course of regimen,
assisted by medicines, which are calculated
to correct that particular habit, and to induce an
almost total change in the constitution.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. LI.<br> <span class='c015'>OF DISLOCATIONS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When a bone is moved out of its place or
articulation, so as to impede its proper functions,
it is said to be <i>luxated</i> or <i>dislocated</i>. As this
often happens to persons in situations where no medical
assistance can be obtained, by which means
limbs, and even lives, are frequently lost, we shall
endeavour to point out the method of reducing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_587'>587</span>the most common luxations, and those which require
immediate assistance. Any person of common
sense and resolution, who is present when a
dislocation happens, may often be of more service
to the patient, than the most expert surgeon can
after the swelling and inflammation have come on.
When these are present, it is difficult to know the
state of the joint, and dangerous to attempt a reduction;
and by waiting till they are gone off, the
muscles become so relaxed, and the cavity filled
up, that the bone can never afterwards be retained
in its place.</p>

<p class='c008'>A recent dislocation may generally be reduced
by extension alone, which must always be greater
or less according to the strength of the muscles
which move the joint, the age, robustness, and
other circumstances of the patient. When the
bone has been out of its place for any considerable
time, and a swelling or inflammation has come on,
it will be necessary to bleed the patient, and, after
fomenting the part, to apply soft poultices with
vinegar to it for some time before the reduction is
attempted.</p>

<p class='c008'>All that is necessary after the reduction, is to
apply cloths dipt in vinegar or camphorated spirits
of wine to the part, and to keep it perfectly easy.
Many bad consequences proceed from the neglect
of this rule. A dislocation seldom happens without
the tendons and ligaments of the joint being
stretched and sometimes torn. When these are
kept easy till they recover their strength and tone,
all goes on very well; but is the injury be increased
by too frequent an exertion of the parts, no wonder
if they be found weak and diseased ever
after.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_588'>588</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>DISLOCATION OF THE JAW.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The lower jaw may be luxated by yawning,
blows, falls, chewing hard substances, or the like.
It is easily known from the patient’s being unable
to shut his mouth, or to eat any thing, as
the teeth of the under jaw do not correspond with
those of the upper; besides, the chin either hangs
down, or is thrown toward one side, and the patient
is neither able to speak distinctly, nor to swallow
without considerable difficulty.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual method of reducing a dislocated jaw,
is to set the patient upon a low stool, so as an assistant
may hold the head firm by pressing it against
his breast. The operator is then to thrust his two
thumbs, being first wrapped up with linen cloths
that they may not slip, as far back into the patient’s
mouth as he can, while his fingers are applied
to the jaw externally. After he has got firm
hold of the jaw, he is to press it strongly downwards
and backwards, by which means the elapsed
heads of the jaw may be easily pushed into their
former cavities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The peasants in some parts of the country have
a peculiar way of performing this operation. One
of them puts a handkerchief under the patient’s
chin, then turning his back to that of the patient,
pulls him up by the chin so as to suspend him from
the ground. This method often succeeds, but we
think it a dangerous one, and therefore recommend
the former.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_589'>589</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>DISLOCATION OF THE NECK.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>The neck may be dislocated by falls, violent
blows, or the like. In this case, if the patient receives
no assistance, he soon dies, which makes
people imagine the neck was broken; it is, however,
for the most part only partially dislocated,
and may be reduced by almost any person who has
resolution enough to attempt it. A complete dislocation
of the neck is instantaneous death.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the neck is dislocated, the patient is immediately
deprived of all sense and motion; his
neck swells, his countenance appears bloated; his
chin lies upon his breast, and his face is generally
turned towards one side.</p>

<p class='c008'>To reduce this dislocation, the unhappy person
should immediately be laid upon his back on the
ground, and the operator must place himself behind
him so as to be able to lay hold of his head with
both hands, while he makes a resistance by placing
his knees against the patient’s shoulders. In this
posture he must pull the head with considerable
force, gently twisting it at the same time, if the
face be turned to one side, till he perceives that
the joint is replaced, which may be known from
the noise which the bones generally make when going
in, the patient’s beginning to breathe, and the
head continuing in its natural posture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is one of those operations which it is more
easy to perform than describe. I have known instances
of its being happily performed even by
women, and often by men of no medical education.
After the neck is reduced, the patient ought
to be bled, and should be suffered to rest for some
days, till the parts recover their proper tone.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_590'>590</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>DISLOCATION OF THE RIBS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>As the articulation of the ribs with the backbone
is very strong, they are not often dislocated.
It does however sometimes happen, which is a sufficient
reason for our taking notice of it. When a
rib is dislocated either upwards or downwards, in
order to replace it, the patient should be laid upon
his belly on a table, and the operator must endeavour
to push the head of the bone into its proper
place. Should this method not succeed, the
arm of the disordered side may be suspended over
a gate or ladder, and, while the ribs are thus
stretched asunder, the heads of such as are out of
place may be thrust into their former situation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those dislocations wherein the heads of the ribs
are forced inwards, are both more dangerous and
the most difficult to reduce, as neither the hand
nor any instrument can be applied internally to direct
the luxated heads of the ribs. Almost the
only thing that can be done is, to lay the patient
his belly over a cask, or some gibbous body,
and to move the fore-part of the rib inward towards
the back, sometimes shaking it; by this
means the heads of the luxated ribs may slip into
their former place.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DISLOCATION OF THE SHOULDER.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The humerus or upper bone of the arm may be
dislocated in various directions: it happens however
most frequently downwards, but very seldom
directly upwards. From the nature of its articulation,
as well as from its exposure to external injuries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_591'>591</span>this bone is the most subject to dislocation
of any in the body. A dislocation of the humerus
may be known by a depression or cavity on the top
of the shoulder, and an inability to move the arm.
When the dislocation is downward or forward, the
arm is elongated, and a ball or lump is perceived
under the arm-pit; but when it is backward, there
appears a protuberance behind the shoulder, and
the arm is thrown forwards toward the breast.</p>

<p class='c008'>The usual method of reducing dislocations of
the shoulder is to seat the patient upon a low stool,
and to cause an assistant to hold his body so that it
may not give way to the extension, while another
lays hold of the arm a little above the elbow, and
gradually extends it. The operator then puts a
napkin under the patient’s arm, and causes it to
be tied behind his own neck: by this, while a sufficient
extension is made, he lifts up the head of
the bone, and with his hands directs it into its
proper place. There are various machines invented
for facilitating this operation, but the hand of an
expert surgeon is always more safe. In young and
delicate patients, I have generally found it a very
easy matter to reduce the shoulder, by extending
the arm with one hand, and thrusting in the head
of the bone with the other. In making the extension,
the arm ought always to be a little bent.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DISLOCATION OF THE ELBOW.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The bones of the fore-arm may be dislocated in
any direction. When this is the case, a protuberance
may be observed on that side of the arm
towards which the bone is pushed, from which,
and the patient’s inability to bend his arm, a dislocation
of this joint may easily be known.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_592'>592</span>Two assistants are generally necessary for reducing
a dislocation of the elbow; one of them must
lay hold of the arm above, and the other below
the joint, and make a pretty strong extension, while
the operator returns the bones into their proper
place. Afterwards the arm must be bent, and suspended
for some time with a sling about the neck.</p>

<p class='c008'>Luxations of the wrist and fingers are to be reduced
in the same manner as those of the elbow,
<i>viz.</i> by making an extension in different directions,
and thrusting the head of the bone into its place.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DISLOCATION OF THE THIGH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When the thigh-bone is dislocated forward and
downward, the knee and foot are turned out, and
the leg is longer than the other; but when it is
displaced backward, it is usually pushed upward at
the same time, by which means the limb is shortened,
and the foot is turned inwards.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the thigh-bone is displaced forward and
downward, the patient, in order to have it reduced,
must be laid upon his back, and made fast
by bandages, or held by assistants, while by others
an extension is made by means of slings fixed about
the bottom of the thigh a little above the knee.
While the extension is made, the operator must
push the head of the bone outward, till it gets
into the socket. If the dislocation be outward, the
patient must be laid upon his face, and, during the
extension, the head of the bone must be pushed
inward.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dislocations of the <i>knees</i>, <i>ancles</i>, and <i>toes</i>, are
reduced much in the same manner as those of the
upper extremities, <i>viz.</i> by making an extension in
opposite directions, while the operator replaces the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_593'>593</span>bones. In many cases, however, the extension
alone is sufficient, and the bone will slip into its
place merely by pulling the limb with sufficient
force. It is not hereby meant, that force alone is
sufficient for the reduction of dislocations. Skill
and address will often succeed better than force. I
have known a dislocation of the thigh reduced by
one man, after all the force that could be used by
six had proved ineffectual.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. LII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF BROKEN BONES, &#38;c.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>There is, in most country villages, some
person who pretends to the art of reducing
fractures. Though in general such persons are very
ignorant, yet some of them are very successful;
which evidently proves, that a small degree of
learning, with a sufficient share of common sense
and a mechanical head, will enable a man to be
useful in this way. We would, however, advise
people never to employ such operators, when an
expert and skilful surgeon can be had; but when
that is impracticable, they must be employed: we
shall therefore recommend the following hints to
their consideration:</p>

<p class='c008'>When a large bone is broken, the patient’s diet
ought in all respects to be the same as in an inflammatory
fever. He should likewise be kept quiet
and cool, and his body open by emollient clysters;
or, if these cannot be conveniently administered,
by food that is. of an opening quality; as stewed
prunes, apples boiled in milk, boiled spinage, and
the like. It ought however to be here remarked,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_594'>594</span>that persons who have been accustomed to live
high, are not all of a sudden to be reduced to a
very low diet. This might have fatal effects.
There is often a necessity for indulging even bad
habits, in some measure, where the nature of the
disease might require a different treatment.</p>

<p class='c008'>It will generally be necessary to bleed the patient
immediately after a fracture, especially if he be
young, of a full habit, or has at the same time received
any bruise or contusion. This operation
should not only be performed soon after the accident
happens, but if the patient be very feverish, it
may be repeated next day. When several of the
ribs are broken, bleeding is peculiarly necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>If any of the large bones which support the body
are broken, the patient must keep his bed for several
weeks. It is by no means necessary, however,
that he should lie all that time, as is customary,
upon his back. This situation sinks the spirits,
galls and frets the patient’s skin, and renders him
very uneasy. After the second week he may be
gently raised up, and may sit several hours, supported
by a bed-chair, or the like, which will
greatly relieve him. Great care, however, must
be taken in raising him up, and laying him down,
that he make no exertions himself, otherwise the
action of the muscles may pull the bone out of
its place<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c010'><sup>[199]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_595'>595</span>It is of great importance to keep the patient
dry and clean while in this situation. By neglecting
this, he is often so galled and excoriated, that
he is forced to keep shifting places for ease. I
have known a fractured thigh-bone, after it had
been kept straight for above a fortnight, displaced
by this means, and continue bent for life, in spite
of all that could be done.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been customary when a bone was broken,
to keep the limb for five or six weeks continually
upon the stretch. But this is a bad posture. It is
both uneasy to the patient, and unfavourable to
the cure. The best situation is to keep the limb a
little bent. This is the posture into which every
animal puts its limbs when it goes to rest, and in
which fewest muscles are upon the stretch. It is
easily effected, by either laying the patient upon
his side, or making the bed so as to favour this position
of the limb.</p>

<p class='c008'>Bone-setters ought carefully to examine whether
the bone be not shattered or broken into several
pieces. In this case it will sometimes be necessary
to have the limb immediately taken off, otherwise
a gangrene or mortification may ensue. The
horror which attends the very idea of an amputation
often occasions its being delayed in such cases
till too late. I have known this principle operate
so strongly, that a limb, where the bones were
shattered into more than twenty pieces, was not
amputated before the third day after the accident,
when the gangrene had proceeded so far as to render
the operation useless.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a fracture is accompanied with a wound,
it must be dressed in all respects as a common
wound.</p>

<p class='c008'>All that art can do towards the cure of a broken
bone, is to lay it perfectly straight, and to
keep it quite easy. All tight bandages do hurt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_596'>596</span>They had much better be wanting altogether. A
great many of the bad consequences which succeed
to fractured bones are owing to tight bandages.
This is one of the ways in which the excess of art,
or rather the abuse of it, does more mischief than
would be occasioned by the want of it. Some of
the most sudden cures of broken bones which were
ever known, happened where no bandages were
applied at all. Some method however must be
taken to keep the member steady; but this may be
done many ways without bracing it with a tight
bandage.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best method of retention is by two or more
splints made of leather or pasteboard. These, if
moistened before they be applied, soon assume the
shape of the included member, and are sufficient,
by the assistance of a very slight bandage, for all
the purposes of retention. The bandage which
we would recommend is that made with twelve or
eighteen tails. It is much easier applied and taken
off than rollers, and answers all the purposes of
retention equally well. The splints should always
be as long as the limb, with holes cut for the ancles
when the fracture is in the leg.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fractures of the ribs, where a bandage cannot
be properly used, an adhesive plaster may be applied
over the part. The patient in this case ought
to keep himself quite easy, avoiding every thing
that may occasion sneezing, laughing, coughing,
or the like. He ought to keep his body in a
straight posture, and should take care that his stomach
be constantly distended, by taking frequently
some light food, and drinking freely of weak watery
liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper external application for a fracture
is <i>oxycrate</i>, or a mixture of vinegar and water.
The bandages should be wet with this at every
dressing.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_597'>597</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF STRAINS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Strains are often attended with worse consequences
than broken bones. The reason is obvious;
they are generally neglected. When a bone
is broken, the patient is obliged to keep the member
easy, because he cannot make use of it; but
when a joint is only strained, the person, finding
he can still make a shift to move it, is sorry to lose
his time for so trifling an ailment. In this way he
deceives himself, and converts into an incurable
malady what might have been removed by only
keeping the part easy for a few days.</p>

<p class='c008'>Country people generally immerse a strained limb
in cold water. This is very proper, provided it
be done immediately, and not kept in too long.
But the custom of keeping the part immersed in
cold water for a long time is certainly dangerous.
It relaxes instead of bracing the part, and is more
likely to produce a disease than remove one.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wrapping a garter, or some other bandage,
pretty tight about the strained part, is likewise of
use. It helps to restore the proper tone of the vessels,
and prevents the action of the parts from increasing
the disease. It should not however be applied
too tight. I have frequently known bleeding
near the affected part have a very good effect:
but what we would recommend above all is <i>ease</i>.
It is more to be depended on than any medicine,
and seldom fails to remove the complaint<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c010'><sup>[200]</sup></a>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_598'>598</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF RUPTURES.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Children and old people are most liable to this
disease. In the former it is generally occasioned
by excessive crying, coughing, vomiting, or the
like. In the latter, it is commonly the effect of
blows or violent exertions of the strength, as leaping,
carrying great weights, &#38;c. In both, a relaxed
habit, indolence, and an oily or very moist
diet, dispose the body to this disease.</p>

<p class='c008'>A rupture sometimes proves fatal before it is
discovered. Whenever sickness, vomiting, and
obstinate costiveness give reason to suspect an obstruction
of the bowels, all those places where ruptures
usually happen ought carefully to be examined.
The protrusion of a very small part of the
gut will occasion all these symptoms; and, if not
returned in due time, will prove mortal.</p>

<p class='c008'>On the first appearance of a rupture in an infant,
it ought to be laid upon its back, with its head very
low. While in this posture, if the gut does not
return of itself, it may easily be put up by gentle
pressure. After it is returned, a piece of sticking-plaster
may be applied over the part, and a proper
truss or bandage must be constantly worn for a considerable
time. The method of making and applying
these rupture-bandages for children is pretty
well known. The child must, as far as possible,
be kept from crying, and from all violent exertions,
till the rupture is quite healed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In adults, when the gut has been forced down
with great violence, or happens from any cause to
be inflamed, there is often great difficulty in returning
it, and sometimes the thing is quite impracticable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_599'>599</span>without an operation; a description of
which is foreign to our purpose. As I have been
fortunate enough, however, always to succeed in
my attempts to return the gut, without having recourse
to any other means than what are in the
power of every man, I shall briefly mention the
method which I generally pursue.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the patient has been bled, he must be laid
upon his back, with his head very low, and his
breech raised high with pillows. In this situation
flannel cloths wrung out of a decoction of mallows
and camomile-flowers, or, if these are not at
hand, of warm water, must be applied for a considerable
time. A clyster made of this decoction,
with a large spoonful of butter and an ounce or two
of salt, may be afterwards thrown up. If these
should not prove successful, recourse must be had
to pressure. If the tumour be very hard, considerable
force will be necessary; but it is not force alone
which succeeds here. The operator, at the same
time that he makes a pressure with the palms of his
hand, must with his fingers artfully conduct the gut
in by the same aperture through which it came out.
The manner of doing this can be much easier conceived
than described. Should these endeavours
prove ineffectual, clysters of the smoke of tobacco
may be tried. These have been often known to
succeed where every other method failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>There is reason to believe that, by persisting in
the use of these, and such other means as the circumstances
of the case may suggest, most <i>hernias</i>
might be reduced without an operation. Cutting
for the <i>hernia</i> is a nice and difficult matter. I would
therefore advise surgeons to try every method of
returning the gut before they have recourse to the
knife. I have once and again succeeded by persevering
in my endeavours, after eminent surgeons had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_600'>600</span>declared the reduction of the gut impracticable
without an operation<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c010'><sup>[201]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>An adult, after the gut has been returned, must
wear a steel bandage. It is needless to describe
this, as it may always be had ready made from the
artists. Such bandages are generally uneasy to the
wearer for some time, but by custom they become
quite easy. No person who has had a rupture after
he arrived at man’s estate should ever be without
one of these bandages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who have a rupture ought carefully to
avoid all violent exercise, carrying great weights,
leaping, running, and the like. They should likewise
avoid windy aliment and strong liquors; and
should carefully guard against catching cold.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. LIII.<br> <span class='c015'>OF CASUALTIES.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>It is certain that life, when to all appearance
lost, may often, by due care, be restored. Accidents
frequently prove fatal, merely because proper
means are not used to counteract their effects,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_601'>601</span>No person ought to be looked upon as killed by
any accident, unless where the structure of the
heart, brain, or some organ necessary to life, is
evidently destroyed. The action of these organs
may be so far impaired as even to be for some time
imperceptible, when life is by no means gone. In
this case, however, if the fluids be suffered to grow
cold, it will be impossible to put them again in
motion, even though the solids should recover their
power of acting. Thus, when the motion of the
lungs has been stopt by unwholesome vapour, the
action of the heart by a stroke on the breast, or the
functions of the brain by a blow on the head, if
the person be suffered to grow cold, he will in all
probability continue so; but, if the body be kept
warm, as soon as the injured part has recovered its
power of acting, the fluids will again begin to
move, and all the vital functions will be restored.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is a horrid custom immediately to consign
over to death every person who has the misfortune,
by a fall, a blow, or the like, to be deprived of
the appearance of life. The unhappy person, instead
of being carried into a warm house, and laid
by the fire, or put to a warm bed, is generally hurried
away to church, or a barn, or some other cold
damp house, where, after a fruitless attempt has
been made to bleed him, perhaps by one who
knew nothing of the matter, he is given over for
dead, and no further notice taken of him. This
conduct seems to be the result of ignorance, supported
by an ancient superstitious notion, which
forbids the body of any person killed by accident
to be laid in an house that is inhabited. What the
ground of this superstition may be, we shall not
pretend to inquire; but surely the conduct founded
upon it is contrary to all the principles of reason,
humanity, and common sense.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_602'>602</span>When a person seems to be suddenly deprived of
life, our first business is to inquire into the cause.
We ought carefully to observe whether any substance
be lodged in the wind-pipe or gullet; and, if
that is the case, attempts must be made to remove
it. When unwholesome air is the cause, the patient
ought immediately to be removed out of it.
If the circulation be suddenly stopped, from any
cause whatever, except mere weakness, the patient
should be bled. If the blood does not flow, he
may be immersed in warm water, or rubbed with
warm cloths, &#38;c. to promote the circulation.
When the cause cannot be suddenly removed, our
great aim must be to keep up the vital warmth, by
rubbing the patient with hot cloths, or salt, and
covering his body with warm sand, ashes, or the
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>I should now proceed to treat more fully of those
accidents, which, without immediate assistance,
would often prove fatal, and to point out the most
likely means for relieving the unhappy sufferers;
but as I have been happily anticipated in this part
of my subject by the learned and humane Dr.
Tissot, I shall content myself with selecting such
of his observations as seem to be the most important,
and adding such of my own as have occurred
in the course of practice.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF SUBSTANCES STOPT BETWEEN THE MOUTH AND STOMACH.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Though accidents of this kind are very common,
and extremely dangerous, yet they are generally
the effect of carelessness. Children should be
taught to chew their food well, and to put nothing
into their mouths which it would be dangerous for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_603'>603</span>them to swallow. But children are not the only
persons guilty of this piece of imprudence. I
know many adults who put pins, nails, and other
sharp-pointed substances in their mouths upon every
occasion, and some who even sleep with the former
there all night. This conduct is exceedingly injudicious,
as a fit of coughing, or twenty other accidents,
may force over the substance before the
person is aware<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c010'><sup>[202]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>When any substance is detained in the gullet,
there are two ways of removing it, <i>viz.</i> either by
extracting it, or pushing it down. The safest and
most certain way is to extract it; but this is pot
always the easiest; it may therefore be more eligible
sometimes to thrust it down, especially when
the obstructing body is of such a nature, that there
is no danger from its reception into the stomach.
The substances which may be pushed down without
danger are, all common nourishing ones, as bread,
flesh, fruits, and the like. All indigestible bodies,
as cork, wood, bones, pieces of metal, and such
like, ought if possible to be extracted, especially if
these bodies be sharp pointed, as pins, needles,
fish-bones, bits of glass, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When such substances have not passed in too
deep, we should endeavour to extract them with
our fingers, which method often succeeds. When
they are lower, we must make use of nippers, or a
small pair of forceps, such as surgeons use. But
this attempt to extract rarely succeeds, if the substance
be of a flexible nature, and has descended
far into the gullet.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the fingers and nippers fail, or cannot be duly
applied, crotchets, a kind of hooks, must be employed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_604'>604</span>These may be made at once, by bending
a piece of pretty strong iron wire at one end. It
must be introduced in the flat way; and for the
better conducing it, there should likewise be a
curve or bending at the end it is held by, to serve
as a kind of handle to it; which has this further
use, that it may be secured by a string tied to it, a
circumstance not to be omitted in any instrument
employed on such occasions, to avoid such ill accidents
as have sometimes ensued from these instruments
slipping out of the operator’s hand. After
the crotchet has passed below the substance that obstructs
the passage, it is drawn up again, and
hooks up the body along with it. The crotchet is
also very convenient, when a substance somewhat
flexible, as a pin or fish-bone, sticks across the gullet,
the hook, in such cases, seizing them about
their middle part, crooks and thus disengages
them; or, if they are very brittle substances, serves
to break them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the obstructing bodies are small, and only
stop up a part of the passage, and which may either
easily elude the hook, or straiten it by their resistance,
a kind of rings, made either of wire, wool,
or silk, may be used. A piece of fine wire of a
proper length may be bent into a circle, about the
middle, of about an inch diameter, and the long
unbent sides brought parallel, and near each other:
these are to be held in the hand, and the circular
part or ring introduced into the gullet, in order to
be conduced about the obstructing body, and so
to extract it. More flexible rings may be made of
wool, thread, silk, or small pack-thread, which
may be waxed for their greater strength and consistence.
One of these is to be tied fast to a handle
of iron wire, whale-bone, or any kind of flexible
wood, and by this means introduced, in order to
surround the obstructing substance, and to draw it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_605'>605</span>out. Several of these rings passed through one
another may be used, the more certainly to lay hold
of the obstructing body, which may be involved
by one, if another should miss it. These rings
have one advantage, which is, that when the substance
to be extracted is once laid hold of, it may
then, by turning the handle, be retained so strongly
in the ring thus twitted, as to be moved every
way, which must in many cases be a considerable
advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another material employed on these unhappy occassions
is the sponge. Its property of swelling
considerably on being wet is the principal foundation
of its usefulness here. If any substance is
stopt in the gullet, but without filling up the
whole passage, a bit of sponge may be introduced
into that part which is unstopt, and beyond the
substance. The sponge soon dilates, and grows
larger in this moist situation; and indeed the enlargement
of it may be forwarded by making the
patient swallow a few drops of water. Afterwards
it is to be drawn back by the handle to which it is
fastened; and as it is now too large to return
through the small cavity by which it was conveyed
in, it draws out the obstructing body along with
it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The compressibility of sponge is another foundation
of its usefulness in such cases. A pretty large
piece of sponge may be compressed or squeezed
into a small size, by winding a string of tape closely
about it, which may be easily unwound, and
withdrawn, after the sponge has been introduced.
A bit of sponge may likewise be, compressed by a
piece of whale-bone split at one end; but this can
hardly be introduced in such a manner as not to
hurt the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have often known pins and other sharp bodies,
which had stuck in the throat, brought up by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_606'>606</span>causing the person to swallow a bit of tough meat
tied to a thread, and drawing it quickly up again.
This is safer than swallowing sponge, and will
often answer the purpose equally well.</p>

<p class='c008'>When all these methods prove unsuccessful,
there remains one more, which is, to make the
patient vomit: but this can scarcely be of any service,
unless when such obstructing bodies are
simply engaged in, and not hooked or stuck into
the sides of the gullet, as in this case vomiting
might sometimes occasion further mischief. If
the patient can swallow, vomiting may be excited
by taking half a drachm or two scruples of ipecacuanha
in powder made into a draught. If he is
not able to swallow, an attempt may be made to
excite vomiting, by tickling his throat with a feather;
and, if that should not succeed, a clyster of
tobacco may be administered. It is made by boiling
an ounce of tobacco in a sufficient quantity of
water: this has often been found to succeed, when
other attempts to excite vomiting had failed.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the obstructing body is of such a nature
that it may with safety be pushed downwards, this
may be attempted by means of a wax-candle oiled,
and a little heated, so as to make it flexible; or a
piece of whale-bone, wire, or flexible wood, with
a sponge fastened to one end.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should it be impossible to extract even those bodies
which it is dangerous to admit into the stomach,
we must then prefer the least of two evils,
and rather run the hazard of pushing them down
than suffer the patient to perish in a few minutes;
and we ought to scruple this resolution the less, as
a great many instances have happened, where the
swallowing of such hurtful and indigestible substances
has been followed by no disorder.</p>

<p class='c008'>Whenever it is manifest that all endeavours either
to extract or push down the substance must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_607'>607</span>prove ineffectual, they should be discontinued;
because the inflammation occasioned by persisting
in them might be as dangerous as the obstruction
itself. Some have died in consequence of the inflammation,
even after the body which caused the
obstruction had been entirely removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>While the means recommended above are making
use of, the patient should often swallow, or, if he
cannot, he should frequently receive by injection
through a crooked tube or pipe that may reach
down to the gullet, some emollient liquor, as warm
milk and water, barley-water, or a decoction of
mallows. Injections of this kind not only soften
and sooth the irritated parts, but, when thrown in
with force, are often more successful in loosening
the obstruction than all attempts with instruments.</p>

<p class='c008'>When, after all our endeavours, we are obliged
to leave the obstructing body in the part, the patient
must be treated as if he had an inflammatory
disease. He should be bled, kept upon a low
diet, and have his whole neck surrounded with
emollient poultices. The like treatment must
also be used, if there be any reason to suspect an
inflammation of the passages, though the obstructing
body be removed.</p>

<p class='c008'>A proper degree of agitation has sometimes loosened
the inhering body more effectually than instruments.
Thus, a blow on the back has often forced
up a substance which stuck in the gullet; but this
is still more proper and efficacious when the substance
gets into the wind-pipe. In this case, vomiting
and sneezing are likewise to be excited.
Pins, which stuck in the gullet, have been frequently
discharged by riding on horseback, or in
a carriage.</p>

<p class='c008'>When any indigestible substance has been forced
down into the stomach, the patient should use a very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_608'>608</span>mild and smooth diet, consisting chiefly of fruits
and farinaceous substances, as puddings, pottage,
and soups. He should avoid all heating and irritating
things, as wine, punch, pepper, and such
like; and his drink should be milk and water,
barley-water, or whey.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the gullet is so strongly and fully closed,
that the patient can receive no food by the mouth,
he must be nourished by clysters of soup, jelly, and
the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient is in danger of being immediately
suffocated, and all hope of freeing the passage
is vanished, so that death seems at hand, if respiration
be not restored; the operation of <i>bronchotomy</i>,
or opening of the wind-pipe, must be directly
performed. As this operation is neither difficult
to an expert surgeon, nor very painful to the
patient, and is often the only method which can
be taken to preserve life in these emergencies, we
thought proper to mention it, though it should
only be attempted by persons skilled in surgery.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF DROWNED PERSONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When a person has remained above a quarter of
an hour under water, there can be no considerable
hopes of his recovery. But as several circumstances,
may happen to have continued life, in such
an unfortunate situation, beyond the ordinary term,
we should never too soon resign the unhappy object
to his fate, but try every method for his relief,
as there are many well attested proofs of the
recovery of persons to life and health who had
been taken out of the water apparently dead, and
who remained a considerable time without exhibiting
any signs of life.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_609'>609</span>The first thing to be done, after the body is taken
out of the water, is to convey it as soon as
possible to some convenient place where the necessary
operations for its recovery may be performed.
In doing this, care must be taken not to bruise or
injure the body by carrying it in any unnatural
posture with the head downwards, or the like. If
an adult body, it ought to be laid on a bed, or on
straw, with the head a little raised, and carried on
a cart or on men’s shoulders, and kept in as natural
and easy a position as possible. A small body
may be carried in the arms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In attempting to recover persons apparently
drowned, the principal intention to be pursued is,
<i>to restore the natural warmth</i>, upon which all the
vital functions depend; and to excite these functions
by the application of stimulants, not only to
the skin, but likewise to the lungs, intestines,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though cold was by no means the cause of the
person’s death, yet it will prove an effectual obstacle
to his recovery. For this reason, after stripping
him of his wet clothes, his body must be
strongly rubbed for a considerable time with coarse
linen cloths, as warm as they can be made; and,
as soon as a well-heated bed can be got ready, he
may be laid in it, and the rubbing should be continued.
Warm cloths ought likewise to be frequently
applied to the stomach and bowels, and hot
bricks, or bottles of warm water, to the soles of
his feet, and to the palms of his hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strong volatile spirits should be frequently applied
to the nose; and the spine of the back and
pit of the stomach may be rubbed with warm
brandy or spirit of wine. The temples ought always
to be chafed with volatile spirits; and stimulating
powders, as that of tobacco or marjoram,
may be blown up the nostrils.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_610'>610</span>To renew the breathing, a strong person may
blow his own breath into the patient’s mouth with
all the force he can, holding his nostrils at the
same time. When it can be perceived by the
rising of the chest or belly that the lungs are filled
with air, the person ought to desist from blowing,
and should press the breast and belly so as to expel
the air again; and this operation may be repeated
for some time, alternately inflating and depressing
the lungs so as to imitate natural respiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the lungs cannot be inflated in this manner,
it may be attempted by blowing through one of
the nostrils, and at the same time keeping the other
close. Dr. Monro for this purpose recommends a
wooden pipe fitted at one end for filling the nostril,
and at the other for being blown into by a person’s
mouth, or for receiving the pipe of a pair of bellows,
to be employed for the same purpose, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When air cannot be forced into the chest by the
mouth or nose, it may be necessary to make an
opening into the wind-pipe for this purpose. It is
needless, however, to spend time in describing this
operation, as it should not be attempted unless by
persons skilled in surgery.</p>

<p class='c008'>To stimulate the intestines, the fume of tobacco
may be thrown up in form of clyster. There are
various pieces of apparatus contrived for this purpose,
which may be used when at hand; but where
these cannot be obtained, the business may be done
by a common tobacco-pipe. The bowl of the
pipe must be filled with tobacco well kindled, and,
after the small tube has been introduced into the
fundament, the smoke may be forced up by blowing
through a piece of paper full of holes wrapped
round the mouth of the pipe, or by blowing
through an empty pipe, the mouth of which is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_611'>611</span>applied close to that of the other. This may
also be done in the following manner: A common
clyster-pipe with a bag mounted upon it may
be introduced into the fundament, and the mouth
of the bag may be applied round the small end of
a tobacco-pipe, in the bowl of which tobacco is to
be kindled, and the smoke blown up as directed
above. Should it be found impracticable to throw
up the smoke of tobacco, clysters of warm water,
with the addition of a little salt and some wine or
spirits, may be frequently administered. This may
be done by a common clyster-bag and pipe; but,
as it ought to be thrown well up, a pretty large
syringe will answer the purpose better.</p>

<p class='c008'>While these things are doing, some of the attendants
ought to be preparing a warm bath, into
which the person should be put, if the above endeavours
prove ineffectual. Where there are no
conveniencies for using the warm bath, the body
may be covered with warm salt, sand, ashes, grains,
or such like. Tissot mentions an instance of a girl
who was restored to life, after she had been taken
out of the water, swelled, bloated, and to all appearance
dead, by laying her naked body upon hot
ashes, covering her with others equally hot, putting
a bonnet round her head, and a stocking round
her neck stuffed with the same, and heaping coverings
over all. After she had remained half an
hour in this situation, her pulse returned, she recovered
speech, and cried out, <i>I freeze, I freeze</i>;
a little cherry-brandy was given her, and she remained
buried as it were under the ashes for eight
hours; afterwards she was taken out, without any
other complaint except that of lassitude or weariness,
which went off in a few days. The Doctor
mentions likewise an instance of a man who was
restored to life, after he had remained six hours
under water, by the heat of a dunghill.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_612'>612</span>Till the patient shews some signs of life, and is
able to swallow, it would be useless and even dangerous
to pour liquors into his mouth. His lips,
however, and tongue, may be frequently wet with a
feather dipt in warm brandy or other strong spirits;
and, as soon as he has recovered the power of swallowing,
a little warm wine, or some other cordial,
ought every now and then to be administered.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some recommend a vomit after the patient is a
little re-animated; but if he can be made to puke
without the sickening draught, it will be more safe:
this may generally be done by tickling the throat
and fauces with an oiled feather, or some other soft
substance, which will not injure the parts. Tissot
in this case recommends the oxymel of squills,
a table-spoonful of which, diluted with water, may
be given every quarter of an hour, till the patient
has taken five or six doses. Where that medicine
is not at hand, a strong infusion of sage, camomile-flowers,
or <i>carduus benedictus</i>, sweetened with
honey, or some warm water, with the addition of
a little salt, may, he says, supply its place. The
Doctor does not intend that any of these things
should be given in such quantity as to occasion vomiting.
He thinks emetics in this situation are not
expedient.</p>

<p class='c008'>We are by no means to discontinue our assistance
as soon as the patients discover some tokens of
life, since they sometimes expire after these first
appearances of recovering. The warm and stimulating
applications are still to be continued, and
small quantities of some cordial liquor ought frequently
to be administered. Lastly, though the
person should be manifestly re-animated, there
sometimes remain an oppression, a cough, and feverishness,
which effectually constitute a disease.
In this case it will be necessary to bleed the patient
in the arm, and to cause him to drink plentifully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_613'>613</span>of barley-water, elder-flower-tea, or any other soft
pectoral infusions.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such persons as have the misfortune to be deprived
of the appearances of life, by a fall, a blow,
suffocation, or the like, must be treated nearly in
the same manner as those who have been for some
time under water. I once attended a patient who
was so stunned by a fall from a horse, that for
above six hours he scarcely exhibited any signs of
life; yet this man, by being bled, and proper methods
taken to keep up the vital warmth, recovered,
and in a few days was perfectly well. Dr.
Alexander gives an instance to the same purpose,
in the Edinburgh Physical and Literary Essays, of
a man who was to all appearance killed by a blow
on the breast, but recovered upon being immersed
for some time in warm water. These, and other
instances of a similar nature, which might be adduced,
amount to a full proof of this fact, that
many of those unhappy persons who lose their
lives by falls, blows, and other accidents, might
be saved <i>by the use of proper means duly persisted
in</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF NOXIOUS VAPOURS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Air may be many ways rendered noxious, or even
destructive to animals. This may either happen
from its vivifying principle being destroyed, or
from subtle exhalations with which it is impregnated.
Thus air that has passed through burning
fuel is neither capable of supporting fire nor the
life of animals. Hence the danger of sleeping in
close chambers with charcoal fires. Some indeed
suppose the danger here proceeds from the sulphureous
oil contained in the charcoal, which is set at
liberty and diffused all over the chamber; while
<span class='pageno' id='Page_614'>614</span>others imagine it is owing to the air of the room
being charged with phlogiston. Be this as it may,
it is a situation carefully to be avoided. Indeed, it
is dangerous to sleep in a small apartment with a
fire of any kind. I lately saw four persons who had
been suffocated by sleeping in an apartment where
a small fire of coal had been left burning.</p>

<p class='c008'>The vapour which exhales from wine, cyder,
beer, or other liquors, in the state of fermentation,
contains something poisonous, which kills in
the same manner as the vapour of coal. Hence
there is always danger in going into cellars where
a large quantity of these liquors is in a state of fermentation,
especially if they have been close shut
up for some time. There have been many instances
of persons struck dead on entering such
places, and of others who have with difficulty
escaped.</p>

<p class='c008'>When subterraneous caves, that have been very
long shut, are opened, or when deep wells are
cleaned, which have not been emptied for several
years, the vapours arising from them produce the
same effects as those mentioned above. For this
reason, no person ought to venture into a well, pit,
cellar, or any place that is damp, and has been
long shut up, till the air has been sufficiently purified,
by burning gunpowder in it. It is easy to
know, as has been observed in a former part of
this work, when the air of such places is unwholesome,
by letting down a lighted candle, throwing
in burning fuel, or the like. If these continue
to burn, people may safely venture in; but
where they are suddenly extinguished, no one ought
to enter till the air has been first purified by
fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>The offensive smell of lamps and of candles,
especially when their flames are extinguished, operate
like other vapours, though with less violence,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_615'>615</span>and less suddenly. There have however been instances
of people killed by the fumes of lamps
which had been extinguished in a close chamber,
and persons of weak delicate breasts generally find
themselves quickly oppressed in apartments illuminated
with many candles.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such as are sensible of their danger in these
situations, and retreat seasonably from it, are generally
relieved as soon as they get into the open
air, or, if they have any remaining uneasiness, a
little water and vinegar, or lemonade, drank hot,
affords them relief. But when they are so far poisoned,
as to have lost their feeling and understanding,
the following means must be used for their recovery:</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should be exposed to a very pure,
fresh, and open air; and volatile salts, or other stimulating
substances, held to his nose. He should
next be bled in the arm, or if that does not succeed,
in the neck. His legs ought to be put into
warm water, and well rubbed. As soon as he can
swallow, some lemonade, or water and vinegar,
with the addition of a little nitre, may be given
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor are sharp clysters by any means to be neglected;
these may be made, by adding to the
common clyster, syrup of buckthorn and tincture
of senna, of each two ounces; or, in their stead,
half an ounce of Venice turpentine dissolved in the
yolk of an egg. Should these things not be at
hand, two or three large spoonfuls of common
salt may be put into the clyster. The same means,
if necessary, which were recommended in the former
part of this chapter, may be used to restore the circulation,
warmth, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Tossach, surgeon at Alloa, relates the case
of a man suffocated by the steam of burning coal,
whom he recovered by blowing his breath into the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_616'>616</span>patient’s mouth, bleeding him in the arm, and
causing him to be well rubbed and tossed about.
And Dr. Frewen, of Sussex, mentions the case of
a young man who was stupified by the smoke of
sea-coal, but was recovered by being plunged into
cold water, and afterwards laid in a warm bed.</p>

<p class='c008'>The practice of plunging persons suffocated by
noxious vapours in cold water, would seem to be
supported by the common experiment of suffocating
dogs in the <i>grotto del cani</i>, and afterwards
recovering them, by throwing them into the neighbouring
lake.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EFFECTS OF EXTREME COLD.</h4>

<p class='c018'>When cold is extremely severe, and a person is
exposed to it for a long time, it proves mortal, in
consequence of its stopping the circulation in the
extremities, and forcing too great a proportion of
blood towards the brain; so that the patient dies
of a kind of apoplexy, preceded by great sleepiness.
The traveller, in this situation, who finds
himself begin to grow drowsy, should redouble his
efforts to extricate himself from the imminent danger
he is exposed to. This sleep, which he might
consider as some alleviation of his sufferings,
would, if indulged, prove his last.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such violent effects of cold are happily not very
common in this country; it frequently happens,
however, that the hands or feet of travellers are so
benumbed or frozen, as to be in danger of a mortification,
if proper means are not used to prevent
it. The chief danger in this situation arises from
the sudden application of heat. It is very common,
when the hands or feet are pinched with cold,
to hold them to the fire; yet reason and observation
shew that this is a most dangerous and imprudent
practice.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_617'>617</span>Every peasant knows, if frozen meat, fruits, or
roots of any kind, be brought near the fire, or put
into warm water, they will be destroyed, by rottenness,
or a kind of mortification; and that the
only way to recover them, is to immerse them for
some time in very cold water. The same observation
holds with regard to animals in this condition.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the hands or feet are greatly benumbed
with cold, they ought either to be immersed in
cold water, or rubbed with snow, till they recover
their natural warmth and sensibility: after which
the person may be removed into an apartment a
little warmer, and may drink some cups of tea,
or an infusion of elder flowers sweetened with honey.
Every person must have observed, when his
hands were even but slightly affected with cold,
that the best way to warm them was by washing
them in cold water, and continuing to rub them
well for some time.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a person has been so long exposed to the
cold, that all appearances of life are gone, it will
be necessary to rub him all over with snow or cold
water; or, what will answer better, if it can be
obtained, to immerse him in a bath of the very
coldest water. There is the greatest encouragement
to persist in the use of these means, as we
are assured that persons who had remained in the
snow, or had been exposed to the freezing air during
five or six successive days, and who had discovered
no marks of life for several hours, have nevertheless
been revived.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have always thought, that the whitloes, kibes,
chilblains, and other inflammations of the extremities,
which are so common among the peasants
in the cold season, were chiefly occasioned by their
sudden transitions from cold to heat. After they
have been exposed to an extreme degree of cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_618'>618</span>they immediately apply their hands and feet to the
fire, or, if they have occasion, plunge them into
warm water, by which means, if a mortification
does not happen, an inflammation seldom fails to
ensue. Most of the ill consequences from this
quarter might be easily avoided, by only observing
the precautions mentioned above.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EFFECTS OF EXTREME HEAT.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The effects of extreme heat, though not so common
in this country, are no less fatal, and much
more sudden than those of cold. In hot countries
people frequently drop down dead in the streets,
exhausted with heat and fatigue. In this case, if
any warm cordial can be poured into the mouth it
ought to be done. If this cannot be effected, they
may be thrown up in form of a clyster. Volatile
spirits, and other things of a stimulating nature,
may be applied to the skin, which should be well
rubbed with coarse-cloths, whipped with nettles,
or other stimulating things. Some of the ancient
physicians are said to have restored to life persons
apparently dead, by beating them with rods.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. LIV.<br> <span class='c015'>OF FAINTING FITS, AND OTHER CASES WHICH REQUIRE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Strong and healthy persons, who abound
with blood, are often seized with sudden fainting
fits, after violent exercise, drinking freely of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_619'>619</span>warm or strong liquors, exposure to great heat, intense
application to study, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>In such cases the patient should be made to smell
to some vinegar. His temples, forehead, and
wrists ought at the same time to be bathed with vinegar
mixed with an equal quantity of warm water;
and two or three spoonfuls of vinegar, with
four or five times as much water, may, if he can
swallow, be poured into his mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the fainting proves obstinate, or degenerates
into a <i>syncope</i>, that is, an abolition of feeling and
understanding, the patient must be bled. After
the bleeding, a clyster will be proper, and then
he should be kept easy and quiet, only giving him
every half hour a cup or two of an infusion of
any mild vegetable, with the addition of a little
sugar and vinegar.</p>

<p class='c008'>When swoonings, which arise from this cause,
occur frequently in the same person, he should, in
order to escape them, confine himself to a light
diet, confiding chiefly of bread, fruits, and other
vegetables. His drink ought to be water or small
beer, and he should deep but moderately, and
take much exercise.</p>

<p class='c008'>But fainting fits proceed much oftner from a
defect than an excess of blood. Hence they are
very ready to happen after great evacuations of any
kind, obstinate watching, want of appetite, or
such like. In these an almost directly opposite
course to that mentioned above must be pursued.</p>

<p class='c008'>The patient should be laid in bed, with his head
low, and being covered, should have his legs,
thighs, arms, and his whole body rubbed strongly
with hot flannels. Hungary water, volatile salts,
or strong smelling herbs, as rue, mint, or rosemary,
may be held to his nose. His mouth may
be wet with a little rum or brandy; and, if he
can swallow, some hot wine, mixed with sugar and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_620'>620</span>cinnamon, which is an excellent cordial, may be
poured into his mouth. A compress of flannel dipt
in hot wine or brandy must be applied to the pit of
his stomach, and warm bricks, or bottles filled
with hot water, laid to the feet.</p>

<p class='c008'>As soon as the patient is recovered a little, he
should take some strong soup or broth, or a little
bread or biscuit soaked in hot-spiced wine. To
prevent the return of the fits, he ought to take
often, but in small quantities, some light yet
strengthening nourishment, as panado made with
soup instead of water, new laid eggs lightly poached,
chocolate, light roast meats, jellies, and such
like.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those fainting fits, which are the effect of bleeding,
or of the violent operation of purges, belong
to this class. Such as happen after artificial bleeding
are seldom dangerous, generally terminating
as soon as the patient is laid upon the bed; indeed
persons subject to this kind should always be
bled lying, in order to prevent it. Should the
fainting however continue longer than usual, volatile
spirits may be held to the nose, and rubbed on
the temples, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>When fainting is the effect of too strong or acrid
purges or vomits, the patient must be treated in
all respects as if he had taken poison. He should
be made to drink plentifully of milk, warm water,
and oil, barley-water, or suck like; emollient
clysters will likewise be proper, and the patient’s
strength should afterwards be recruited, by giving
him generous cordials, and anodyne medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Faintings are often occasioned by indigestion.
This may either proceed from the quantity or
quality of the food. When the former of these
is the cause, the cure will be best performed by vomiting,
which may be promoted by causing the patient
to drink a weak infusion of camomile-flowers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_621'>621</span><i>carduus benedictus</i> or the like. When the disorder
proceeds from the nature of the food, the patient,
as in the case of weakness, must be revived
by strong smells, &#38;c. after which he should be
made to swallow a large quantity of light warm
fluid, which may serve to drown, as it were, the
offending matter, to soften its acrimony, and either
to effect a discharge of it by vomiting, or
force it down into the intestines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Even disagreeable smells will sometimes occasion
swoonings, especially in people of weak nerves.
When this happens, the patient should be carried
into the open air, have stimulating things held to
his nose, and those substances which are disagreeable
to him ought immediately to be removed.
But we have already taken notice of swoonings
which arise from nervous disorders, and shall therefore
say no more upon that head.</p>

<p class='c008'>Fainting fits often happen in the progress of
diseases. In the beginning of putrid diseases they
generally denote an oppression at stomach, or a
mass of corrupted humours, and they cease after
evacuations either by vomit or stool. When they
occur at the beginning of malignant fevers, they
indicate great danger. In each of these cases,
vinegar used both externally and internally is the
best remedy during the paroxysm, and plenty of
lemon-juice and water after it. Swoonings which
happen in diseases accompanied with great evacuations,
must be treated like those which are owing
to weakness, and the evacuations ought to be
restrained. When they happen towards the end of
a violent fit of an intermitting fever, or at that
of each exacerbation of a continual fever, the patient
must be supported by small draughts of wine
and water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Delicate and hysteric women are very liable to
swooning or fainting fits after delivery. These
<span class='pageno' id='Page_622'>622</span>might be often prevented by generous cordials, and
the admission of fresh air. When they are occasioned
by excessive flooding, it ought by all means
to be restrained. They are generally the effect of
mere weakness or exhaustion. Dr. Engleman relates
the case of a woman “in child-bed, who,
after being happily delivered, suddenly fainted,
and lay upwards of a quarter of an hour apparently
dead. A physician was sent for; her own
maid, in the mean while, being out of patience
at his delay, attempted to assist her herself, and
extending herself upon her mistress, applied her
mouth to her’s, blew in as much breath as she
possibly could, and in a very short time the exhausted
woman awaked as out of a profound
sleep; when proper things being given her, she
soon recovered.</p>

<p class='c008'>“The maid being asked how she came to think
of this expedient, said she had seen it practised
at Altenburgh, by midwives, upon children with
the happiest effect.”</p>

<p class='c008'>We mention this case chiefly that other midwives
may be induced to follow so laudable an example.
Many children are born without any signs
of life, and others expire soon after the birth, who
might, without all doubt, by proper care, be restored
to life.</p>

<p class='c008'>From whatever cause fainting fits proceed, fresh
air is always of the greatest importance to the patient.
By not attending to this circumstance, people
often kill their friends while they are endeavouring
to save them. Alarmed at the patient’s
situation, they call in a crowd of people to his assistance,
or perhaps to witness his exit, whose
breathing exhausts the air, and increases the danger.
There is not the least doubt but this practice,
which is very common among the lower sort
of people, often proves fatal, especially to the delicate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_623'>623</span>and such persons as fall into fainting fits
from mere exhaustion, or the violence of some disease.
No more persons ought ever to be admitted
into the room where a patient lies in a swoon than
are absolutely necessary for his assistance, and the
windows of the apartment should always be opened,
at least as far as to admit a stream of fresh air.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons subject to frequent swoonings, or fainting
fits, should neglect no means to remove the
cause of them, as their consequences are always
injurious to the constitution. Every fainting fit
leaves the person in dejection and weakness; the
secretions are thereby suspended, the humours disposed
to stagnation, coagulations and obstructions
are formed, and, if the motion of the blood be totally
intercepted, or very considerably checked, <i>polypuses</i>
are sometimes formed in the heart or larger
vessels. The only kind of swoonings not to be
dreaded are those which sometimes mark the <i>crisis</i>
in fevers; yet even these ought, as soon as possible,
to be removed.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OF INTOXICATION.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The effects of intoxication are often fatal. No
kind of poison kills more certainly than an over-dose
of ardent spirits. Sometimes, by destroying the
nervous energy, they put an end to life at once; but
in general their effects are more slow, and in many
respects similar to those of opium. Other kinds
of intoxicating liquors may prove fatal when taken
to excess, as well as ardent spirits; but they may
generally be discharged by vomiting, which ought
always to be excited when the stomach is overcharged
with liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>More of those unhappy persons, who die intoxicated,
lose their lives from an inability to conduct
<span class='pageno' id='Page_624'>624</span>themselves than from the destructive quality of the
liquor. Unable to walk, they tumble down, and
lie in some awkward posture, which obstructs the
circulation or breathing, and often continue in this
situation till they die. No drunken person should be
left by himself, till his clothes have been loosened,
and his body laid in such a posture as is most favourable
for continuing the vital motions, discharging
the contents of the stomach, &#38;c. The
best posture for discharging the contents of the
stomach is to lay the person upon his belly; when
asleep he may be laid on his side, with his head a
little raised, and particular care must be taken that
his neck be no way bent, twisted, or have any thing
too tight about it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The excessive degree of thirst occasioned by
drinking strong liquors, often induces people to
quench it by taking what is hurtful. I have known
fatal consequences even from drinking freely of
milk after a debauch of wine or sour punch; these
acid liquors, together with the heat of the stomach,
having coagulated the milk in such a manner
that it could never be digested. The safest
drink after a debauch is water with a toast, tea,
infusions of balm, sage, barley-water, and such
like. If the person wants to vomit, he may drink
a weak infusion of camomile-flowers, or lukewarm
water and oil; but in this condition vomiting may
generally be excited by only tickling the throat
with the finger or a feather.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of giving a detail of all the different
symptoms of intoxication which indicate danger,
and proposing a general plan of treatment for persons
in this situation, I shall briefly relate the history
of a case which lately fell under my own observation,
wherein most of those symptoms usually
reckoned dangerous concurred, and where the treatment
was successful.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_625'>625</span>A young man, about fifteen years of age, had,
for a hire, drank ten glasses of strong brandy. He
soon after fell fast asleep, and continued in that situation
for near twelve hours, till at length his uneasy
manner of breathing, the coldness of the extremities,
and other threatening symptoms, alarmed his
friends, and made them send for me. I found him
still sleeping, his countenance ghastly, and his skin
covered with a cold clammy sweat. Almost the
only signs of life remaining were, a deep laborious
breathing, and a convulsive motion or agitation
of his bowels.</p>

<p class='c008'>I tried to rouse him, but in vain, by pinching,
shaking, applying volatile spirits, and other stimulating
things to his nose, &#38;c. A few ounces
of blood were likewise taken from his arm, and a
mixture of vinegar and water was poured into his
mouth; but, as he could not swallow, very little
of this got into the stomach. None of these things
having the least effect, and the danger seeming to
increase, I ordered his legs to be put into warm
water, and a sharp clyster to be immediately administered.
This gave him a stool, and was the first
thing that relieved him. It was afterwards repeated
with the same happy effect, and seemed to
be the chief cause of his recovery. He then began
to shew some signs of life, took drink when it
was offered him, and came gradually to his senses.
He continued, however, for several days weak and
feverish, and complained much of a soreness in
his bowels, which gradually went off, by means of
a slender diet, and cool mucilaginous liquors.</p>

<p class='c008'>This young man would probably have been suffered
to die, without any assistance being called,
had not a neighbour, a few days before, who had
been advised to drink a bottle of spirits to cure him
of an ague, expired under very similar circumstances.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_626'>626</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF SUFFOCATION AND STRANGLING·</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>These may sometimes proceed from an infarction
of the lungs, produced by viscid clammy humours,
or a spasmodic affection of the nerves of that organ.
Persons who feed grossly, and abound in
rich blood, are very liable to suffocating fits from
the former of these causes. Such ought, as soon
as they are attacked, to be bled, to receive an emollient
clyster, and to take frequently a cup of diluting
liquor with a little nitre in it. They should
likewise receive the steams of hot vinegar into their
lungs by breathing.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nervous and asthmatic persons are most subject
to spasmodic affections of the lungs. In this case
the patient’s legs should be immersed in warm water,
and the steams of vinegar applied as above.
Warm diluting liquors should likewise be drank;
to a cup of which a tea-spoonful of the parygoric
elixir may occasionally be added. Burnt paper,
feathers, or leather, may be held to the patient’s
nose, and fresh air should be freely admitted to
him.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infants are often suffocated by the carelessness or
inattention of their nurses<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c010'><sup>[203]</sup></a>. An infant when in
bed should always be laid so, that it cannot tumble
down with its head under the bed-clothes; and
when in a cradle, its face ought never to be covered.
A small degree of attention to these two
<span class='pageno' id='Page_627'>627</span>simple rules would save the lives of many infants,
and prevent others from being rendered weak and
sickly all their days by the injuries done to their
lungs.</p>

<p class='c008'>Instead of laying down a plan for the recovery
of infants who are suffocated, or overlaid, as it is
termed by their nurses, I shall give the history of
a case related by Monsieur <i>Janin</i>, of the Royal
College of Surgery at Paris, as it was attended
with success, and contains almost every thing that
can be done on such occasions.</p>

<p class='c008'>A nurse having had the misfortune to over-lay a
child, he was called in, and found the infant without
any signs of life; no pulsation in the arteries,
no respiration, the face livid, the eyes open, dull,
and tarnished, the nose full of snivel, the mouth
gaping, in short it was almost cold. Whilst some
linen clothes and a parcel of ashes were warming,
he had the boy unswathed, and laid him
in a warm bed, and on the right side. He then
was rubbed all over with fine linen, for fear of fretting
his tender and delicate skin. As soon as the
ashes had received their due degree of heat, Mr.
<i>Janin</i> buried him in them, except the face, placed
him on the side opposite to that on which he had
been at first laid, and covered him with a blanket.
He had a bottle of <i>eau de luce</i> in his pocket, which
he presented to his nose from time to time; and between
whiles some puffs of tobacco were blown up
his nostrils: to these succeeded the blowing into his
mouth, and squeezing tight his nose. Animal heat
began thus to be excited gradually; the pulsations
of the temporal artery were soon felt, the breathing
became more frequent and free, and the eyes closed
and opened alternately. At length the child fetched
some cries expressive of his want of the breast,
which being applied to his mouth, he catched at
it with avidity, and sucked as if nothing had happened
<span class='pageno' id='Page_628'>628</span>to him. Though the pulsations of the arteries
were by this time very well re-established,
and it was hot weather, yet Mr. <i>Janin</i> thought it
advisable to leave his little patient three quarters of
an hour longer under the ashes. He was afterwards
taken out, cleaned and dressed as usual; to which
a gentle sleep succeeded, and he continued perfectly
well.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Janin mentions likewise an example of a
young man who had hanged himself through
despair, to whom he administered help as effectually
as in the preceding case.</p>

<p class='c008'>Mr. Glover, surgeon in Doctors Commons,
London, relates the case of a person who was restored
to life after twenty-nine minutes hanging,
and continued in good health for many years
after.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal means used to restore this man to
life were, opening the temporal artery and the external
jugular; rubbing the back, mouth, and
neck, with a quantity of volatile spirits and oil;
administering the tobacco clyster by means of
lighted pipes, and strong frictions of the legs and
arms. This course had been continued for about
four hours, when an incision was made into the
wind-pipe, and air blown strongly through a canula
into the lungs. About twenty minutes after
this, the blood at the artery began to run down the
face, and a slow pulse was just perceptible at the
wrist. The frictions were continued for some time
longer; his pulse became more frequent, and his
mouth and nose being irritated with spirit of sal
ammoniac, he opened his eyes. Warm cordials
were then administered to him, and in two days he
was so well as to be able to walk eight miles.</p>

<p class='c008'>These cases are sufficient to shew what may be
done for the recovery of those unhappy persons who
strangle themselves in a fit of despair.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_629'>629</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>OF PERSONS WHO EXPIRE IN CONVULSION FITS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Convulsion fits often constitute the last scene of
acute or chronic disorders. When this is the case,
there can remain but small hopes of the patient’s
recovery after expiring in a fit. But when a person,
who appears to be in perfect health, is suddenly
seized with a convulsion fit, and seems to
expire, some attempts ought always to be made to
restore him to life. Infants are most liable to convulsions,
and are often carried off very suddenly
by one or more fits about the time of teething.
There are many well-authenticated accounts of infants
having been restored to life, after they had
to all appearance expired in convulsions; but we
shall only relate the following instance mentioned
by Dr. Johnson in his pamphlet <i>on the practicability
of recovering persons visibly dead</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the parish of St. <i>Clemens</i> in <i>Colchester</i>, a child
of six months old, lying upon its mother’s lap,
having had the breast, was seized with a strong
convulsion fit, which lasted so long, and ended
with so total a privation of motion in the body,
lungs, and pulse, that it was deemed absolutely
dead. It was accordingly stripped, laid out, the
passing-bell ordered to be tolled, and a coffin to
be made; but a neighbouring gentlewoman who
used to admire the child, hearing of its sudden
death, hastened to the house, and upon examining
the child found it not cold, its joints limber, and
fancied that a glass she held to its mouth and nose
was a little damped with the breath; upon which
she took the child in her lap, sat down before the
fire, rubbed it, and kept it in gentle agitation. In
a quarter of an hour she felt the heart begin to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_630'>630</span>beat faintly; she then put a little of the mother’s
milk into its mouth, continued to rub its palms
and soles, found the child begin to move, and the
milk was swallowed; and in another quarter of an
hour she had the satisfaction of restoring to its disconsolate
mother the babe quite recovered, eager
to lay hold of the breast, and able to suck again.
The child throve, had no more fits, is grown up,
and at present alive.</p>

<p class='c008'>These means, which are certainly in the power
of every person, were sufficient to restore to life an
infant to all appearance dead, and who, in all probability,
but for the use of these simple endeavours,
would have remained so. There are however
many other things which might be done in
case the above should not succeed; as rubbing the
body with strong spirits, covering it with warm
ashes or salt, blowing air into the lungs, throwing
up warm stimulating clysters, or the smoke of tobacco,
into the intestines, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>When children are dead born, or expire soon
after the birth, the same means ought to be used for
their recovery, as if they had expired in circumstances
similar to those mentioned above.</p>

<p class='c008'>These directions may likewise be extended to
adults, attention being always paid to the age and
other circumstances of the patient.</p>

<p class='c008'>The foregoing cases and observations afford sufficient
proof of the success which may attend the
endeavours of persons totally ignorant of medicine,
in assisting those who are suddenly deprived of life
by any accident or disease. Many facts of a similar
nature might be adduced, were it necessary;
but these, it is hoped, will be sufficient to call up
the attention of the public, and to excite the humane
and benevolent to exert their utmost endeavours
for the preservation of their fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_631'>631</span><i>The society for the recovery of drowned persons</i>, instituted
at Amsterdam in the year 1767, had the
satisfaction to find that not fewer than 150 persons
in the space of four years had been saved by the
means pointed out by them, many of whom owed
their preservation to peasants and people of no medical
knowledge. But the means used with so much
efficacy in recovering drowned persons are, with
equal success, applicable to a number of cases
where the powers of life seem in reality to be only
suspended, and to remain capable of renewing all
their functions, on being put into motion again.
It is shocking to reflect, that for want of this consideration
many persons have been committed to
the grave, in whom the principles of life might
have been revived.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cases wherein such endeavours are most likely
to be attended with success, are all those called
sudden deaths from an invisible cause, as apoplexies,
hysterics, faintings, and many other disorders
wherein persons in a moment sink down and
expire. The various casualties in which they may
be tried are, suffocations, from the sulphureous
damps of mines, coal-pits, &#38;c.; the unwholesome
air of long unopened wells or caverns; the noxious
vapours arising from fermenting liquors; the steams
of burning charcoal; sulphureous mineral acids;
arsenical effluvia, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The various accidents of drowning, strangling,
and apparent deaths, by blows, falls, hunger, cold,
&#38;c. likewise furnish opportunities of trying such
endeavours. Those perhaps who to appearance are
killed by lightning, or by any violent agitation of
the passions, as fear, joy, surprise, and such like,
might also be frequently recovered by the use of
proper means, as blowing strongly into their
lungs, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_632'>632</span>The means to be used for the recovery of persons
suddenly deprived of life are nearly the same
in all cases; they are practicable by every one who
happens to be present at the accident, and require
no great expence, and less skill. The great aim is
to restore the warmth and vital motions. This
may in general be attempted by means of heat,
frictions, bleeding, blowing air into the lungs, administering
clysters and generous cordials. These
must be varied according to circumstances. Common
sense, and the situation of the patient, will
suggest the proper manner of conducting them.
Above all we would recommend <i>perseverance</i>.
People ought never to despair on account of discouraging
circumstances, or to leave off their endeavours
as long as there is the least hope of success.
Where much good and no hurt can be done,
no one ought to grudge his labour.</p>

<p class='c008'>It were greatly to be wished, that an institution,
similar to that of Amsterdam, was established, upon
a more extensive plan, in Great Britain; and
that a reward was allowed to every one who should
be instrumental in restoring to life a person seemingly
dead<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c010'><sup>[204]</sup></a>. Men will do much for fame, but
still more for money. Should no profit, however,
be annexed to those benevolent offices, the heartfelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_633'>633</span>pleasure which a good man must enjoy, on reflecting
that he has been the happy instrument of
saving one of his fellow-creatures from an untimely
grave, is itself a sufficient reward.</p>

<h3 class='c001'>CHAP. LV.<br> <span class='c015'>CAUTIONS CONCERNING COLD BATHING, AND DRINKING THE MINERAL WATERS.</span></h3>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>As it is now fashionable for persons of all ranks
to plunge into the sea, and drink the mineral
waters, I was desirous of rendering this work still
more extensively useful, by the addition of some
practical remarks on these active and useful medicines.
Finding it impossible to bring these observations
within so narrow a compass as not to
swell the book, already too large, into an enormous
size, I resolved to confine myself to a few
hints or cautions; which may be of service to persons
who bathe, or drink the mineral waters, without
being able to put themselves under the care of
a physician.</p>

<p class='c008'>No part of the practice of medicine is of greater
importance, or merits more the attention of the
physician, as many lives are lost, and numbers
ruin their health, by cold bathing, and an imprudent
use of the mineral waters. On some future
occasion I may probably resume this subject, as I
know not any work that contains a sufficient number
of practical observations to regulate the patient’s
conduct in the use of these active and important
medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_634'>634</span>We have indeed many books on the mineral
waters, and some of them are written with much
ingenuity; but they are chiefly employed in ascertaining
the contents of the waters by chymical analysis.
This no doubt has its use, but it is by no
means of such importance as some may imagine.
A man may know the chymical analysis of all the
articles in the <i>materia medica</i>, without being able
properly to apply any one of them in the cure of
diseases. One page of practical observations is
worth a whole volume of chymical analysis. But
where are such observations to be met with? Few
physicians are in a situation to make them, and
fewer still are qualified for such a task. It can
only be accomplished by practitioners who reside at
the fountains, and who possessing minds superior
to local prejudices, are capable of distinguishing
diseases with accuracy, and of forming a sound
judgment respecting the genuine effects of medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>Without a proper discrimination with regard to
the disease and the constitution of the patient, the
most powerful medicine is more likely to do harm
than good. Every one knows that the same physician
who, by cold bathing, cured Augustus, by
an imprudent use of the same medicine killed his
heir. This induced the Roman senate to make
laws for regulating the baths, and preventing the
numerous evils which arose from an imprudent and
promiscuous use of those elegant and fashionable
pieces of luxury. But as no such laws exist in this
country, <i>every one does that which is right in his
own eyes</i>, and of course many must do wrong.</p>

<p class='c008'>People are apt to imagine that the simple element
of water can do no hurt, and that they may
plunge into it at any time with impunity. In this,
however, they are much mistaken. I have known
apoplexies occasioned by going into the cold bath,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_635'>635</span>fevers excited by staying too long in it, and other
maladies so much aggravated by its continued use,
that they could never be wholly eradicated. Nor
are examples wanting, either in ancient or modern
times, of the baneful consequences which have
arisen also from an injudicious application of the
<i>warm</i> bath; but as warm baths are not so common
in this country, and are seldom used but under the
direction of a physician, I shall not enlarge on
that part of the subject.</p>

<p class='c008'>Immersion in cold water is a custom which lays
claim to the most remote antiquity: indeed it must
have been coëval with man himself. The necessity
of water for the purpose of cleanliness, and the
pleasure arising from its application to the body in
hot countries, must very early have recommended
it to the human species. Even the example of
other animals was sufficient to give the hint to
man. By instinct many of them are led to apply
cold water in this manner; and some, when deprived
of its use, have been known to languish,
and even to die. But whether the practice of cold
bathing arose from necessity, reasoning, or imitation,
is an inquiry of no importance; our business
is to point out the advantages which may be derived
from it, and to guard people against an improper
use of it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold bath recommends itself in a variety of
cases, and is peculiarly beneficial to the inhabitants
of populous cities, who indulge in idleness,
and lead sedentary lives. In persons of this description
the action of the solids is always too weak,
which induces a languid circulation, a crude indigested
mass of humours, and obstructions in the
capillary vessels and glandular system. Cold water,
from its gravity as well as its tonic power, is
well calculated either to obviate or remove these
symptoms. It accelerates the motion of the blood,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_636'>636</span>promotes the different secretions, and gives permanent
vigour to the solids. But all these important
purposes will be more essentially answered
by the application of <i>salt-water</i>. This ought not
only to be preferred on account of its superior
gravity, but likewise for its greater power of stimulating
the skin, which promotes the perspiration,
and prevents the patient from catching
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is necessary, however, to observe, that cold
bathing is more likely to prevent, than to remove
obstructions of the glandular or lymphatic system.
Indeed, when these have arrived at a certain pitch,
they are not to be removed by any means. In this
case the cold bath will only aggravate the symptoms,
and hurry the unhappy patient into an untimely
grave. It is therefore of the utmost importance,
previous to the patient’s entering upon
the use of the cold bath, to determine whether or
not he labours under any obstinate obstructions of
the lungs or other <i>viscera</i>; and where this is the
case, cold bathing ought strictly to be prohibited<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c010'><sup>[205]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In what is called a plethoric state, or too great
a fulness of the body, it is likewise dangerous to
use the cold bath, without due preparation. In
this case there is great danger of bursting a blood-vessel,
or occasioning an inflammation of the brain,
or some of the <i>viscera</i>. This precaution is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_637'>637</span>more necessary to citizens, as most of them live
full, and are of a gross habit. Yet, what is very
remarkable, these people resort in crowds every
season to the sea-side, and plunge in the water
without the least consideration. No doubt they
often escape with impunity, but does this give a
sanction to the practice? Persons of this description
ought by no means to bathe, unless the body
has been previously prepared by suitable evacuations.</p>

<p class='c008'>Another class of patients, who stand peculiarly
in need of the bracing qualities of cold water, is
the nervous. This includes a great number of the
male, and almost all the female inhabitants of
great cities. Yet even those persons ought to be
cautious in using the cold bath. Nervous people
have often weak bowels, and may, as well as others,
be subject to congestions and obstructions of the
<i>viscera</i>; and in this case they will not be able to
bear the effects of the cold water. For them, therefore,
and indeed for all delicate people, the best
plan would be to accustom themselves to it by the
most pleasing and gentle degrees. They ought to
begin with the temperate bath, and gradually use
it cooler, till at length the coldest proves quite
agreeable. Nature revolts against all great transitions;
and those who do violence to her dictates,
have often cause to repent of their temerity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wherever cold bathing is practised, there ought
likewise to be tepid baths for the purpose mentioned
above. Indeed it is the practice of some countries
to throw cold water over the patient as soon as he
comes out of the warm bath; but though this may
not injure a Russian peasant, we dare not recommend
it to the inhabitants of this country. The
ancient Greeks and Romans, we are told, when
covered with sweat and dust, used to plunge into
rivers, without receiving the smallest injury.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_638'>638</span>Though they might often escape danger from this
imprudent conduct, yet it was certainly contrary
to sound reason. I have known many robust men
throw away their lives by such an attempt. We
would not however advise patients to go into the
cold water when the body is chilly; as much exercise,
at least, ought to be taken, as may excite a
gentle glow all over the body, but by no means so
as to overheat it.</p>

<p class='c008'>To young people, and particularly to children,
cold bathing is of the last importance. Their lax
fibres render its tonic powers peculiarly proper.
It promotes their growth, increases their strength<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c010'><sup>[206]</sup></a>,
and prevents a variety of diseases incident to childhood.
Were infants early accustomed to the cold
bath, it would seldom disagree with them; and we
should see fewer instances of the scrofula, rickets,
and other diseases, which prove fatal to many, and
make others miserable for life. Sometimes, indeed,
these disorders render infants incapable of
bearing the shock of cold water; but this is owing
to their not having been early and regularly accustomed
to it. It is however necessary here to
caution young men against too frequent bathing;
as I have known many fatal consequences result
from the daily practice of plunging into rivers,
and continuing there too long.</p>

<p class='c008'>The most proper time of the day for using the
cold bath is no doubt the morning, or at least before
dinner; and the best mode, that of quick immersion.
As cold bathing has a constant tendency
<span class='pageno' id='Page_639'>639</span>to propel the blood and other humours towards the
head, it ought to be a rule always to wet that part
as soon as possible. By due attention to this circumstance,
there is reason to believe, that violent
head-achs, and other complaints, which frequently
proceed from cold bathing, might be often
prevented.</p>

<p class='c008'>The cold bath, when too long-continued in, not
only occasions an excessive flux of humours towards
the head, but chills the blood, cramps the muscles,
relaxes the nerves, and wholly defeats the intention
of bathing. Hence, by not adverting to this
circumstance, expert swimmers are often injured,
and sometimes even lose their lives. All the beneficial
purposes of cold bathing are answered by
one immersion at a time; and the patient ought
to be rubbed dry the moment he comes out of the
water, and should continue to take exercise for
some time after.</p>

<p class='c008'>When cold bathing occasions chillness, loss of
appetite, listlessness, pain of the breast or bowels, a
prostration of strength, or violent head-achs, it
ought to be discontinued.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though these hints are by no means intended to
point out all the cases where cold bathing may
be hurtful, nor to illustrate its extensive utility
as a medicine; yet it is hoped they may serve to
guard people against some of those errors into
which, from mere inattention, they are apt to fall,
and thereby not only endanger their own lives, but
bring an excellent medicine into disrepute.</p>

<h4 class='c017'><i>Of drinking the Mineral Waters.</i></h4>

<p class='c018'>The internal use of water, as a medicine, is no
less an object of the physician’s attention than the
external. Pure elementary water is indeed the most
<span class='pageno' id='Page_640'>640</span>inoffensive of all liquors, and constitutes a principal
part of the food of every animal. But this
element is often impregnated with substances of a
very active and penetrating nature; and of such an
insidious quality, that, while they promote certain
secretions, and even alleviate some disagreeable
symptoms, they weaken the powers of life, undermine
the constitution, and lay the foundation of
worse diseases than those which they were employed
to remove. Of this every practitioner must have
seen instances; and physicians of eminence have
more than once declared that they have known more
diseases occasioned than removed by the use of mineral
waters. This doubtless has proceeded from
the abuse of these powerful medicines, which evinces
the necessity of using them with caution.</p>

<p class='c008'>By examining the contents of the mineral waters
which are most used in this country, we shall
be enabled to form an idea of the danger which
may arise from an improper application of them
either externally or internally, though it is to the
latter of these that the present observations are
chiefly confined.</p>

<p class='c008'>The waters most in use for medical purposes in
Britain, are those impregnated with salts, sulphur,
iron, and mephitic air, either separately, or variously
combined. Of these the most powerful is
the saline sulphureous water of Harrowgate, of
which I have had more occasion to observe the
pernicious consequences, when improperly used,
than of any other. To this, therefore, the following
remarks will more immediately relate, though
they will be found applicable to all the purging
waters in the kingdom which are strong enough to
merit attention<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c010'><sup>[207]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_641'>641</span>The errors which so often defeat the intention of
drinking the purgative mineral waters, and which
so frequently prove injurious to the patient, proceed
from the manner of using them, the quantity
taken, the regimen pursued, or using them in cases
where they are not proper.</p>

<p class='c008'>A very hurtful prejudice still prevails in this
country, that all diseases must be cured by medicines
taken into the stomach, and that the more
violently these medicines operate, they are the
more likely to have the desired effect. This opinion
has proved fatal to thousands, and will, in all
probability, destroy many more before it can be
wholly eradicated. Purging is often useful in acute
diseases, and in chronical cases may pave the way
for the operation of other medicines; but it will
seldom perform a cure; and by exhausting the
strength of the patient, will often leave him in a
worse condition than it found him. That this is
frequently the case with regard to the more active
mineral waters, every person conversant in these
matters will readily allow.</p>

<p class='c008'>Strong stimulants applied to the stomach and
bowels for a length of time, must tend to weaken
and destroy their energy; and what stimulants are
more active than salt and sulphur, especially when
these substances are intimately combined, and carried
through the system by the penetrating medium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_642'>642</span>of water? Those bowels must be strong indeed,
which can withstand the daily operation of
such active principles for months together, and not
be injured. This however is the plan pursued by
most of those who drink the purging mineral waters,
and whose circumstances will permit them to
continue long enough at those fashionable places
of resort.</p>

<p class='c008'>Many people imagine that every thing depends
on the quantity of water taken, and that the more
they drink they will the sooner get well. This is
an egregious error; for, while the unhappy patient
thinks he is by this means eradicating his
disorder, he is often in fact undermining the powers
of life, and ruining his constitution. Indeed nothing
can do this so effectually as weakening the
powers of digestion by the improper application of
strong stimulants. The very essence of health depends
on the digestive organs performing their due
functions, and the most tedious maladies are all
connected with indigestion.</p>

<p class='c008'>Drinking the water in too great quantity, not
only injures the bowels and occasions indigestion,
but generally defeats the intention for which it is
taken. The diseases for the cure of which mineral
waters are chiefly celebrated, are mostly of the
chronic kind; and it is well known that such diseases
can only be cured by the slow operation of
alteratives, or such medicines as act by inducing a
gradual change in the habit. This requires length
of time, and never can be effected by medicines
which run off by stool, and operate chiefly on the
first passages.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who wish for the cure of any obstinate
malady from the mineral waters, ought to take
them in such a manner as hardly to produce any
effect whatever on the bowels. With this view a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_643'>643</span>half-pint glass may be drank at bed-time<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c010'><sup>[208]</sup></a>, and the
same quantity an hour before breakfast, dinner,
and supper. The dose, however, must vary according
to circumstances. Even the quantity mentioned
above will purge some persons, while others
will drink twice as much without being in the least
moved by it. Its operation on the bowels is the
only standard for using the water as an alterative.
No more ought to be taken than barely to move
the body; nor is it always necessary to carry it this
length, provided the water goes off by the other
emunctories, and does not occasion a chillness, or
flatulency in the stomach or bowels. When the
water is intended to purge, the quantity mentioned
above may be all taken before breakfast.</p>

<p class='c008'>I would not only caution patients who drink the
purging mineral waters over night to avoid heavy
suppers, but also from eating heavy meals at any
time. The stimulus of water, impregnated with
salts, seems to create a false appetite. I have seen
a delicate person, after drinking the Harrowgate
waters of a morning, eat a breakfast sufficient to
have served two ploughmen, devour a plentiful
dinner of flesh and fish, and, to crown all, eat such
a supper as might have satisfied a hungry porter.
All this, indeed, the stomach seemed to crave; but
this craving had better remain not quite satisfied,
than that the stomach should be loaded with what
exceeds its powers. To starve patients was never
my plans; but I am clearly of opinion, that, in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_644'>644</span>use of all the purging mineral waters, a light and
rather diluting diet is the most proper; and that no
person, during such a course, ought to eat to the
full extent to what his appetite craves.</p>

<p class='c008'>To promote the operation of mineral waters,
and to carry them through the system, exercise is
indispensably necessary. This may be taken in any
manner that is most agreeable to the patient; but
he ought never to carry it to excess. The best
kinds of exercise are those connected with amusement.
Every thing that tends to exhilarate the
spirits, not only promotes the operation of the waters,
but acts as a medicine. All who resort to
the mineral waters ought therefore to leave every
care behind, to mix with the company, and to
make themselves as cheerful and happy as possible.
From this conduct, assisted by the free and wholesome
air of those fashionable places of resort, and
also the regular and early hours which are usually
kept, the patient often receives more benefit than
from using the waters.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the greatest errors in drinking the purging
mineral waters arise from their being used in cases
where they are absolutely improper, and adverse to
the nature of the disease. When people hear of a
wonderful cure having been performed by some
mineral water, they immediately conclude that it
will cure every thing, and accordingly swallow it
down, when they might as well take poison. Patients
ought to be well informed, before they begin
to drink the more active kinds of mineral waters,
of the propriety of the course, and should
never persist in using them when they are found to
aggravate the disorder.</p>

<p class='c008'>In all cases where purging is indicated, the saline
mineral waters will be found to fulfil this intention
better than any other medicine. Their operation, if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_645'>645</span>taken in proper quantity, is generally mild; and
they are neither found to irritate the nerves, nor
debilitate the patient so much as the other purgatives.</p>

<p class='c008'>As a purgative, these waters are chiefly recommended
in diseases of the first passages, accompanied
with, or proceeding from, inactivity of the
stomach and bowels, acidity, indigestion, vitiated
bile, worms, putrid sordes, the piles, and jaundice.
In most cases of this kind they are the best
medicines that can be administered. But when
used with this view, it is sufficient to take them
twice, or at most three times a-week, so as to
move the body three or four times; and it will be
proper to continue this course for some weeks.</p>

<p class='c008'>But the operation of the more active mineral waters
is not confined to the bowels. They often
promote the discharge of urine, and not unfrequently
increase the perspiration. This shews that
they are capable of penetrating into every part of
the body, and of stimulating the whole system.
Hence arises their efficacy in removing the most
obstinate of all disorders, <i>obstructions of the glandular
and lymphatic system</i>. Under this class is comprehended
the scrofula or <i>King’s evil</i>, indolent tumours,
obstructions of the liver, spleen, kidnies,
and mesenteric glands. When these great purposes
are to be effected, the waters must be used in
the gradual manner mentioned above, and persisted
in for a length of time. It will be proper however
now and then to discontinue their use for a few days.</p>

<p class='c008'>The next great class of diseases where mineral
waters are found to be beneficial, are those of the
skin, as the itch, scab, tetters, ringworms, scaly
eruptions, leprosies, blotches, foul ulcers, &#38;c.
Though these may seem superficial, yet they are
often the most obstinate which the physician has to
encounter, and not unfrequently set his skill at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_646'>646</span>defiance: but they will sometimes yield to the application
of mineral waters for a sufficient length
of time, and in most cases of this kind these waters
deserve a trial. The saline sulphureous waters,
such as those of Moffat in Scotland, and Harrowgate
in England, are the most likely to succeed
in diseases of the skin; but for this purpose it will
be necessary not only to drink the waters, but likewise
to use them externally.</p>

<p class='c008'>To enumerate more particularly the qualities of
the different mineral waters, to specify those diseases
in which they are respectively indicated, and
to point out their proper modes of application,
would be an useful, and by no means a disagreeable
employment; but as the limits prescribed to
these remarks will not allow me to treat the
subject at more length, I shall conclude by observing,
that whenever the mineral waters are
found to exhaust the strength, depress the spirits,
take away the appetite, excite fevers, distend the
bowels, or occasion a cough, they ought to be
discontinued.</p>

<p class='c021'>⁂ These <i>Cautions</i> having been printed and sold separately
for the accommodation of those who had purchased the former
editions of this book, has induced some persons to consider them
as a Treatise on sea-bathing and drinking the mineral waters;
whereas the author’s sole intention was to furnish a few general
hints to persons who frequent those fashionable places of resort,
without putting themselves under the care of a physician. As
he looks upon this subject however to be of the greatest importance
to the sick, he pledges himself to treat it at more length
on a future occasion.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Ignorance and superstition have attributed extraordinary
medical virtues to almost every production of nature.
That such virtues were often imaginary, time and experience
have sufficiently shewn. Physicians, however, from
a veneration for antiquity, still retain in their lists of medicine
many things which owe their reputation entirely to the
superstition and credulity of our ancestors.</p>

<p class='c008'>The instruments of medicine will always be multiplied, in
proportion to men’s ignorance of the nature and cause of
diseases: when these are sufficiently understood, the method
of cure will be simple and obvious.</p>

<p class='c008'>Ignorance of the real nature and permanent properties of
those substances employed in the cure of diseases, is another
reason why they have been so greatly multiplied. Physicians
thought they could effect by a number of ingredients, what
could not be done by any one of them. Hence arose those
amazing farragos which have so long disgraced the medical
art, and which were esteemed powerful in proportion to the
number of simples that entered their composition.</p>

<p class='c008'>The great variety of forms into which almost every article
of medicine has been manufactured, affords another
proof of the imperfection of the medical art. A drug which
is perhaps most efficacious in the simplest form in which it
can be administered, has been nevertheless served up in so
many different shapes, that one would be induced to think
the whole art of physic lay in exhibiting medicine under as
many different modes as possible.</p>

<p class='c008'>Different forms of medicine, no doubt, have their use;
but they ought never to be wantonly increased. They are
by no means so necessary as is generally imagined. A few
grains of powdered rhubarb, jalap, or ipecacuanha, will
actually perform all that can be done by the different preparations
of these roots, and may also be exhibited in as safe
and agreeable a manner. The same observation holds with
regard to the Peruvian bark, and many other simples of
which the preparations are very numerous.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_650'>650</span>Multiplying the ingredients of a medicine, not only
renders it more expensive, but also less certain, both in its
dose and operation. Nor is this all. The compound, when
kept, is apt to spoil, or acquire qualities of a different nature.
When a medicine is rendered more safe, efficacious, or
agreeable, by the addition of another, they ought, no doubt,
to be joined; in all other cases, they are better kept asunder.
The combination of medicines embarrasses the physician,
and retards the progress of medical knowledge. It is impossible
to ascertain the precise effect of any one medicine, as
long as it is combined with others, either of a similar or dissimilar
nature.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the exhibition of medicine, regard should not only be
had to simplicity, but likewise to elegance. Patients seldom
reap much benefit from things that are highly disagreeable
to their senses. To taste or smell like a drug, is become a
proverb; and to say truth, there is too much ground for it.
Indeed no art can take away the disagreeable taste and flavour
of some drugs, without entirely destroying their efficacy:
it is possible, however, to render many medicines less
disgustful, and others even agreeable; an object highly deserving
the attention of all who administer medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The design of the following pages is, to exhibit such a list
of drugs and medicines as may be necessary for private practice.
They are considerably more numerous indeed than
those recommended in the former part of the Book, but are
still greatly within the number contained in the most reformed
dispensatories. The same medicine is seldom exhibited
under different forms; and where different medicines
answer nearly the same intention, there is commonly no
more than one of them retained. Multiplying forms of
medicine for the same intention tends rather to bewilder
than assist the young practitioner, and the experienced physician
can never be at a loss to vary his prescriptions as occasion
requires.</p>

<p class='c008'>The chemical and other difficult preparations are for the
most part omitted. All of them that are used by any private
practitioner are not worth preparing. He will buy them
much cheaper than he can make them. Great care however
is necessary to obtain them genuine. They are often adulterated,
and ought never to be purchased unless from persons
of known veracity. Such of them as are in common use
<span class='pageno' id='Page_651'>651</span>are inserted in the list of drugs and medicines. Their proper
doses and manner of application, are mentioned in the practical
part of the Book, wherever they are prescribed.</p>

<p class='c008'>Such articles of medicine as are to be found in the house
or garden of almost every peasant, as barley, eggs, onions,
&#38;c. are likewise, for the most part, omitted. It is needless
to swell a list of medicines with such things as can be obtained
whenever they are wanted, and which spoil by being
kept.</p>

<p class='c008'>The preparations made and sold by distillers and confectioners
are also generally left out. These people, by operating
upon a larger plan, generally make things better, while
it is in their power to afford them much cheaper, than they
can be prepared by any private hand.</p>

<p class='c008'>The quantity ordered of every medicine is as small as could
well be prepared, both to prevent unnecessary expence, and
that the medicine might not spoil by keeping. Almost every
medicine suffers by being kept, and should be used as soon
after it has been prepared as possible. Even simple drugs
are apt to spoil, and should therefore be laid in in small
quantities; they either rot, are consumed by insects, or
evaporate so as to lose their peculiar taste or flavour, and
often become quite insignificant.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the preparation of medicines, I have generally followed
the most improved dispensatories; but have taken the liberty
to differ from them wherever my own observations, or those
of other practical writers, on whose judgment I could depend,
suggested an improvement.</p>

<p class='c008'>In several compositions, the ingredient on which the efficacy
of the medicine principally depends is increased, while
the auxiliaries, which are generally ordered in such trifling
quantities as to be of no importance, are left out, or only
such of them retained as are necessary to give the medicine a
proper consistence, or the like.</p>

<p class='c008'>The colouring ingredients are likewise for the most part
omitted. They increase the bulk and price of the medicine;
without adding any thing to its value. It would be well if
they were never used at all. Medicines are often adulterated
for the sake of a colour. Acrid and even poisonous substances
are, for this purpose, sometimes introduced into those
medicines which ought to be most bland and emollient.
Ointment of elder, for example, is often mixed with verdegrise
<span class='pageno' id='Page_652'>652</span>to give it a fine green colour, which entirely frustrates
the intention of that mild ointment. Those who wish to
obtain genuine medicines should pay no regard to their colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some regard is likewise paid to expence. Such ingredients
as greatly increase the price of any composition, without
adding considerably to its virtue, are generally either
omitted, or somewhat less expensive substituted in their place.
Medicines are by no means powerful in proportion to their
price. The cheapest are often the best; besides, they are
the least apt to be adulterated, and are always most readily
obtained.</p>

<p class='c008'>With regard to the method of compounding medicines, I
have generally followed that which seemed to be the most
simple and natural, mentioning the different steps of the process
in the same order in which they ought to be taken,
without paying an implicit regard to the method of other
dispensatories.</p>

<p class='c008'>For many of the remarks concerning the preparation,
&#38;c. of medicines, I have been obliged to the author of the
New Dispensatory. The other observations are either such
as have occurred to myself in practice, or have been suggested
in the course of reading, by authors whose names I am not
able distinctly to recollect.</p>

<p class='c008'>I have followed the alphabetical order, both with regard
to the simples and preparations. A more scientific method
would have been agreeable to some persons, but less useful
to the generality of readers. The different classes of medicine
have no great dependance upon one another; and,
where they have, it is hard to say which should stand first or
last; no doubt the simple preparations ought to precede the
more compound. But all the advantages arising from this
method of arrangement do not appear equal to that single
one, of being able, on the first opening of the book, to find
out any article, which, by the alphabetical order, is rendered
quite easy.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose of every medicine is mentioned whenever it appeared
necessary. When this is omitted it is to be understood
that the medicine may be used at discretion. The dose
mentioned is always for an adult, unless when the contrary
is expressed. It is not an easy matter to proportion the doses
of medicine exactly to the different ages, constitutions, &#38;c.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_653'>653</span>of patients; but, happily for mankind, mathematical exactness
here is by no means necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Several attempts have been made to ascertain the proportional
doses for the different ages and constitutions of patients;
but, after all that can be said upon this subject, a
great deal must be left to the judgment and skill of the person
who administers the medicine. The following general
proportions may be observed; but they are by no means intended
for exact rules. A patient between twenty and fourteen
may take two thirds of the dose ordered for an adult;
from fourteen to nine, one half; from nine to six, one-third;
from six to four, one-fourth; from four to two,
one-sixth; from two to one, a tenth; and below one, a
twelfth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dispensatories are usually written in the Latin language.
Even authors who write in English, generally give their
prescriptions in Latin; and some of them shew so great an
attachment to that language, as first to write their <i>recipes</i> in
it, and afterwards translate them; while others, to compromise
the matter, write the one half in Latin and the other
in English. What peculiar charm a medical prescription,
when written in Latin, may have, I shall not pretend to say;
but have ventured to make use of the plainest English I
could, and hope my prescriptions will succeed no worse for
it.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>N. B.</i> The Apothecary’s weights, and the English wine
measures, are used throughout the whole book, the different
denominations of which will appear from the following

  <h3 class='c001'>MEDICINAL PREPARATIONS.</h3>
</div>
<h4 class='c017'>BALSAMS.</h4>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c026'>The subject of this section is not the natural balsams, but
certain compositions, which, from their being supposed
to possess balsamic qualities, generally go by that name.</p>

<p class='c008'>This class of medicines was formerly very numerous, and
held in great esteem: modern practice, however, has justly
reduced it to a very narrow compass.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Anodyne Balsam.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of white Spanish soap, one ounce; opium, unprepared,
two drachms; rectified spirit of wine, nine ounces.
Digest them together in a gentle heat for three days; then
strain off the liquor, and add to it three drachms of camphor.</p>

<p class='c008'>This balsam, as its title expresses, is intended to ease pain.
It is of service in violent strains and rheumatic complaints,
when not attended with inflammation. It must be rubbed
with a warm hand on the part affected; or a linen rag
moistened with it may be applied to the part, and renewed
every third or fourth hour, till the pain abates. If the opium
is left out, this will be the <i>saponacious balsam</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Locatelli’s Balsam.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of olive oil, one pint; Strasburg turpentine and
yellow wax, of each half a pound; red saunders, six drachms.
Melt the wax with some part of the oil over a gentle fire;
then adding the remaining part of the oil and the turpentine;
afterwards mix in the saunders, previously reduced to a powder,
and keep them stirring together till the balsam is cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>This balsam is recommended in erosions of the intestines,
the dysentery, hæmorrhages, internal bruises, and in some
complaints of the breast. Outwardly it is used for healing
and cleansing wounds and ulcers. The dose, when taken
internally, is from two scruples to two drachms.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>The vulnerary Balsam.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of benzoin, powdered, three ounces; balsam of
Peru, two ounces; hepatic aloes, in powder, half an ounce;
rectified spirit of wine, two pints. Digest them in a gentle
heat for three days, and then strain the balsam.</p>

<p class='c008'>This balsam, or rather tincture, is applied externally to
heal recent wounds and bruises. It is likewise employed internally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_658'>658</span>to remove coughs, asthmas, and other complaints of
the breast. It is said to ease the colic, cleanse the kidnies,
and to heal internal ulcers, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is from twenty to sixty drops.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, though a medicine of some value, does not deserve
the extravagant encomiums which have been bestowed on
it. It has been celebrated under the different names of <i>The
Commander’s Balsam</i>, <i>Persian Balsam</i>, <i>Balsam of Berne</i>, <i>Wade’s
Balsam</i>, <i>Friar’s Balsam</i>, <i>Jesuit’s Drops</i>, <i>Turlington’s Drops</i>,
&#38;c.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>BOLUSES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>As boluses are intended for immediate use, volatile salts
and other ingredients improper for being kept, are admitted
into their composition. They are generally composed
of powders, with a proper quantity of syrup, conserve,
or mucilage. The lighter powders are commonly made
up with syrup, and the more ponderous, as mercury, &#38;c.
with conserve; but those of the lighter kind would be more
conveniently made up with mucilage, as it increases their
bulk less than the other additions, and likewise occasions the
medicine to pass down more easily.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Astringent Bolus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of alum, in powder, fifteen grains; gum kino, five
grains; syrup, a sufficient quantity to make a bolus.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an excessive flow of the <i>menses</i>, and other violent discharges
of blood, proceeding from relaxation, this bolus may
be given every four or five hours, till the discharge abates.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Diaphoretic Bolus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum guaiacum, in powder, ten grains; flowers
of sulphur and cream of tartar, of each one scruple; simple
syrup, a sufficient quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In rheumatic complaints, and disorders of the skin, this
bolus may be taken twice a day. It will also be of service
in the inflammatory quinsey.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Mercurial Bolus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of calomel, six grains; conserve of roses, half a
drachm. Make a bolus.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where mercury is necessary, this bolus may be taken
twice or thrice a week. It may be taken over night; and if
it does not operate, a few grains of jalap will be proper next
day to carry it off.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_659'>659</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Bolus of Rhubarb and Mercury.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of the best rhubarb, in powder, from a scruple to
half a drachm; of calomel, from four to six grains; simple
syrup, a sufficient quantity to make a bolus.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a proper purge in hypochondriac constitutions;
but its principal intention is to expel worms. Where a
stronger purge is necessary, jalap may be used instead of the
rhubarb.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Pectoral Bolus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of sperma-ceti, a scruple; gum ammoniac, ten
grains; salt of hartshorn, six grains; simple syrup, as much
as will make them into a bolus.</p>

<p class='c008'>This bolus is given in colds and coughs of long standing,
asthmas, and beginning consumptions of the lungs. It is
generally proper to bleed the patient before he begins to
use it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Purging Bolus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of jalap, in powder, a scruple; cream of tartar, two
scruples. Let them be rubbed together, and formed into a
bolus, with simple syrup.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where a mild purge is wanted, this will answer the purpose
very well. If a stronger dose is necessary, the jalap
may be increased to half a drachm or upwards.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CATAPLASMS AND SINAPISMS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Cataplasms possess few or no virtues superior to a
poultice, which may be so made, as, in most cases, to
supply their place. They are chiefly intended either to act as
discutients, or to promote suppuration; and as they may be
of service in some cases, we shall give a specimen of each
kind.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Discutient Cataplasm.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of barley-meal, six ounces; fresh hemlock leaves,
bruised; two ounces; vinegar, a sufficient quantity. Boil
the meal and hemlock in the vinegar for a little, and then add
two drachms of the sugar of lead.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Ripening Cataplasm.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of white lily root, four ounces; fat figs and raw
onions, bruised, of each one ounce; yellow basilicum ointment,
two ounces; gum galbanum, half an ounce; linseed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_660'>660</span>meal, as much as necessary. Boil the roots along with the
figs in a sufficient quantity of water; then bruise and add to
them the other ingredients, so as to form the whole into a
soft cataplasm. The galbanum must be previously dissolved
with the yolk of an egg.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where it is necessary to promote suppuration, this cataplasm
may be used by those who chuse to be at the trouble
and expence of making it. For my part, I have never
found any application more proper for this purpose than a
poultice of bread and milk, with a sufficient quantity of
either boiled or raw onion in it, and softened with oil or fresh
butter.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Sinapisms.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Sinapisms are employed to recal the blood and spirits to a
weak part, as in the palsy and atrophy. They are also of
service in deep-seated pains, as the sciatica, &#38;c. When the
gout seizes the head or the stomach, they are applied to the
feet to bring the disorder to these parts. They are likewise
applied to the patient’s soles in the low state of fevers. They
should not be suffered to lie on, however, till they have raised
blisters, but till the parts become red, and will continue so
when pressed with the finger.</p>

<p class='c008'>The sinapism is only a poultice made with vinegar instead
of milk, and rendered warm and stimulating by the addition
of mustard, horse-radish, or garlic.</p>

<p class='c008'>The common sinapism is made by taking crumb of bread
and mustard-seed in powder, of each equal quantities; strong
vinegar, as much as is sufficient, and mixing them so as to
make a poultice.</p>

<p class='c008'>When sinapisms of a more stimulating nature are wanted,
a little bruised garlic may be added to the above.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CLYSTERS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This class of medicines is of more importance than is
generally imagined. clysters serve, not only to evacuate
the contents of the belly, but also to convey very active
medicines into the system. Opium, for example, may
be administered in this way when it will not sit upon the stomach,
and also in larger doses than at any time it can be
taken by the mouth. The Peruvian bark may likewise be,
with good effect, administered in form of clyster to persons
who cannot take it by the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_661'>661</span>A simple clyster can seldom do hurt, and there are many
cases where it may do much good. A clyster even of warm
water, by serving as a fomentation to the parts, may be of
considerable service in inflammations of the bladder, and the
lower intestines, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some substances, as the smoke of tobacco, may be thrown
into the bowels in this way, which cannot by any other
means whatever. This may be easily effected by means of a
pair of hand-bellows, with an apparatus fitted to them for
that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nor is the use of clysters confined to medicines. Aliment
may also be conveyed in this way. Persons unable to swallow,
have been, for a considerable time, supported by
clysters.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Emollient Clyster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of linseed-tea and new milk, each six ounces. Mix
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>If  fifty or sixty drops of laudanum be added to this, it will
supply the place of the <i>Anodyne Clyster</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Laxative Clyster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of milk and water, each six ounces; sweet oil or
fresh butter, and brown sugar, of each two ounces. Mix
them.</p>

<p class='c008'>If an ounce of Glauber’s salt, or two table-spoonfuls of
common salt, be added to this, it will be the <i>Purging Clyster</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Carminative Clyster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of camomile flowers, an ounce; anise-seeds, half an
ounce. Boil in a pint and a half of water to one pint.</p>

<p class='c008'>In hysteric and hypochondriac complaints this may be administered
instead of the <i>Fœtid Clyster</i>, the smell of which is
so disagreeable to most patients.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Oily Clyster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>To four ounces of the infusion of camomile flowers, add
an equal quantity of Florence oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>This clyster is beneficial in bringing off the small worms
lodged in the lower parts of the alimentary canal. When
given to children the quantity must be proportionably lessened.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_662'>662</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Starch Clyster.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take jelly of starch, four ounces; linseed oil, half an
ounce. Liquify the jelly over a gentle fire, and then mix in
the oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the dysentery or bloody flux, this clyster may be administered
after every loose stool, to heal the ulcerated intestines
and blunt the sharpness of corroding humours. Forty or
fifty drops of laudanum may be occasionally added; in which
case, it will generally supply the place of the <i>Astringent
Clyster</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Turpentine Clyster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of common decoction, ten ounces; Venice turpentine,
dissolved with the yolk of an egg, half an ounce; Florence
oil, one ounce. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This diuretic clyster is proper in obstructions of the urinary
passages, and in colicky complaints, proceeding from
gravel.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vinegar Clyster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This clyster is made by mixing three ounces of vinegar
with five of water-gruel.</p>

<p class='c008'>It answers all the purposes of a common clyster, with the
peculiar advantage of being proper either in inflammatory or
putrid disorders, especially in the latter.</p>

<p class='c008'>☞ We think it unnecessary to give more examples of this
class of medicines, as ingredients adapted to any particular
intention may be occasionally added to one or other of the
above forms.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>COLLYRIA, or EYE-WATERS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Eye-waters have been multiplied without number,
almost every person pretending to be possessed of some
secret preparation for the cure of sore eyes. I have examined
many of them, and find that they are pretty much alike,
the basis of most of them being either alum, vitriol, or lead.
Their effects evidently are, to brace and restore the tone of
the parts; hence they are principally of service in slight inflammations;
and in that relaxed state of the parts which is
induced by obstinate ones.</p>

<p class='c008'>Camphor is commonly added to these compositions; but
as it seldom incorporates properly with the water, it can be
of little use. Boles and other earthy substances, as they do
not dissolve in water, are likewise unfit for this purpose.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_663'>663</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Collyrium of Alum.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of alum, half a drachm; agitate it well together
with the white of one egg.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is the Collyrium of Riverius. It is used in inflammation
of the eyes, to allay heat, and restrain the flux of
humours. It must be spread upon linen, and applied to the
eyes; but should not be kept on above three or four hours at
a time.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vitriolic Collyrium.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of white vitriol, half a drachm; rose-water, six
ounces. Dissolve the vitriol in the water, and filter the
liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>This, though simple, is perhaps equal in virtue to most of
the celebrated collyria. It is an useful application in weak,
watery, and inflamed eyes. Though the slighter inflammations
will generally yield to it, yet in those of a more obstinate
nature the assistance of bleeding and blistering will often
be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a strong astringent is judged proper, a double or
triple quantity of the vitriol may be used. I have seen a solution
of four times the strength of the above used with manifest
advantage.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Collyrium of Lead.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take sugar of lead, and crude sal ammoniac, of each four
grains. Dissolve them in eight ounces of common water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Forty or fifty drops of laudanum may be occasionally
added to this collyrium.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who chuse may substitute instead of this the collyrium
of lead recommended by Goulard; which is made by
putting twenty-five drops of his <i>Extract of Lead</i> to eight
ounces of water, and adding a tea-spoonful of brandy.</p>

<p class='c008'>Indeed, common water and brandy, without any other addition,
will in many cases answer very well as a collyrium.
An ounce of the latter may be added to five or six ounces of
the former; and the eyes, if weak, bathed with it night and
morning.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CONFECTIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Confections containing above sixty ingredients are still
to be found in some of the most reformed dispensatories.
As most of their intentions, however, may be more certainly,
and as effectually answered by a few glasses of wine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_664'>664</span>or grains of opium, we shall pass over this class of medicines
very slightly.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Japonic Confection.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Japan earth, three ounces; tormentil root, nutmeg,
olibanum, of each two ounces; opium dissolved in a
sufficient quantity of Lisbon wine, a drachm and a half;
simple syrup and conserve of roles, of each fourteen ounces.
Mix and make them into an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>This supplies the place of the Diascordium.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose of this electuary is from a scruple to a drachm.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>CONSERVES AND PRESERVES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Every Apothecary’s shop was formerly so full of these
preparations, that it might have passed for a confectioner’s
warehouse. They possess very few medicinal properties,
and may rather be classed among sweetmeats than medicines.
They are sometimes, however, of use, for reducing into
boluses or pills some of the more ponderous powders, as the
preparations of iron, mercury, and tin.</p>

<p class='c008'>Conserves are compositions of fresh vegetables and sugar,
beaten together into an uniform mass. In making these
preparations, the leaves of vegetables must be freed from
their stalks, the flowers from their cups, and the yellow
part of orange-peel taken off with a rasp. They are then to
be pounded in a marble mortar, with a wooden pestle, into
a smooth mass; after which, thrice their weight of fine sugar
is commonly added by degrees, and the beating continued
till they are uniformly mixed; but the conserve will be better
if only twice its weight of sugar be added.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who prepare large quantities of conserve generally
reduce the vegetables to a pulp by the means of a mill, and
afterwards beat them up with the sugar.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Conserve of Red Roses.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take a pound of red rose buds, cleared of their heels;
beat them well in a mortar, and, adding by degrees two
pounds of double-refined sugar, in powder, make a conserve.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the same manner are prepared the conserves of
orange-peel, rosemary flowers, sea-wormwood, of the leaves
of wood-sorrel, &#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The conserve of roses is one of the most agreeable and
useful preparations belonging to this class. A drachm or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_665'>665</span>two of it, dissolved in warm milk, is ordered to be given as
a gentle restringent in weakness of the stomach, and likewise
in phthisical coughs, and spitting of blood. To have
any considerable effects, however, it must be taken in larger
quantities.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Conserve of Sloes.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This may be made by boiling the sloes gently in water,
being careful to take them out before they burst; afterwards
expressing the juice, and beating it up with three times its
weight of fine sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>In relaxations of the <i>uvula</i> and glands of the throat, this
makes an excellent gargle, and may be used at discretion.</p>

<p class='c008'><i>Preserves</i> are made by steeping or boiling fresh vegetables
first in water, and afterwards in syrup, or a solution of sugar.
The subject is either preserved moist in the syrup, or taken
out and dried, that the sugar may candy upon it. The last
is the most useful method.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Candied Orange Peel.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Soak Seville orange-peel in several waters, till it loses its
bitterness; then boil it in a solution of double-refined sugar
in water, till it becomes tender and transparent.</p>

<p class='c008'>Candied lemon-peel is prepared in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is needless to add more of these preparations, as they
belong rather to the art of the confectioner than that of the
apothecary.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DECOCTIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Water readily extracts the gummy and saline parts
of vegetables; and though its action is chiefly confined
to these, yet the resinous and oily being intimately
blended with the gummy and saline, are in great part
taken up along with them. Hence watery decoctions and
infusions of vegetables, constitute a large, and not unuseful,
class of medicines. Although most vegetables yield their
virtues to water, as well by infusion as decoction, yet the
latter is often necessary, as it saves time, and does in a few
minutes what the other would require hours, and sometimes
days, to effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>The medicines of this class are all intended for immediate
use.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Decoction of Althæa.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the roots of marsh-mallows, moderately dried,
three ounces; raisins of the sun, one ounce; water, three
pints.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_666'>666</span>Boil the ingredients in the water till one-third of it is consumed;
afterwards strain the decoction and let it stand for
some time to settle. If the roots be thoroughly dried, they
must be boiled till one half the water be consumed.</p>

<p class='c008'>In coughs, and sharp defluctions upon the lungs, this
decoction may be used for ordinary drink.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>The Common Decoction.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of camomile flowers, one ounce; elder flowers, and
sweet fennel seeds, of each half an ounce; water, two quarts.
Boil them for a little, and then strain the decoction.</p>

<p class='c008'>A medicine equally good may be prepared by infusing the
ingredients for some hours in boiling water.</p>

<p class='c008'>This decoction is chiefly intended as the basis of clysters,
to which other ingredients may be occasionally added. It
will likewise serve as a common fomentation, spirit of wine
or other things being added in such quantity as the case may
require.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Decoction of Logwood.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Boil three ounces of the shavings, or chips, of logwood,
in four pints of water, till one half the liquor is wasted.
Two or three ounces of simple cinnamon-water may be
added to this decoction.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fluxes of the belly, where the stronger astringents are
improper, a tea-cupful of this decoction may be taken with
advantage three or four times a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Decoction of the Bark.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Boil an ounce of the Peruvian bark, grossly powdered,
in a pint and a half of water to one pint; then strain the decoction.
If a tea-spoonful of the weak spirit of vitriol be
added to this medicine, it will render it both more agreeable
and efficacious.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Compound Decoction of the Bark.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Peruvian bark and Virginian snake-root, grossly
powdered, each three drachms. Boil them in a pint of
water to one half. To the strained liquor add an ounce and
a half of aromatic water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir John Pringle recommends this as a proper medicine towards
the decline of malignant fevers, when the pulse is low,
the voice weak, and the head affected with a stupor but with
little delirium.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is four spoonfuls every fourth or sixth hour.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_667'>667</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Decoction of Sarsaparilla.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of fresh sarsaparilla root, sliced and bruised, two
ounces; shavings of guaiacum wood, one ounce. Boil over
a slow fire, in three quarts of water, to one; adding towards
the end, half an ounce of sassafras wood, and three drachms
of liquorice. Strain the decoction.</p>

<p class='c008'>This may either be employed as an assistant to a course of
mercurial alteratives, or taken after the mercury has been
used for some time. It strengthens the stomach, and restores
flesh and vigour to habits emaciated by the venereal
disease. It may also be taken in the rheumatism, and cutaneous
disorders proceeding from foulness of the blood and
juices. For all these intentions it is greatly preferable to the
<i>Decoction of Woods</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This decoction may be taken, from a pint and a half to
two quarts in the day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following decoction is said to be similar to that used
by <i>Kennedy</i>, in the cure of the venereal disease, and may supply
the place of Lisbon diet drink:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of sarsaparilla, three ounces; liquorice and mezereon
root, of each half an ounce; shavings of guaiacum and
sassafras wood, of each one ounce; crude antimony, powdered,
an ounce and a half. Infuse these ingredients in
eight pints of boiling water for twenty-four hours, then
boil them till one half of the water is consumed; afterwards
strain the decoction.</p>

<p class='c008'>This decoction may be used in the same manner as the
preceding.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Decoction of Seneka.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of seneka rattle-snake root, one ounce; water, a
pint and a half. Boil to one pint, and strain.</p>

<p class='c008'>This decoction is recommended in the pleurisy, dropsy,
rheumatism, and some obstinate disorders of the skin. The
dose is two ounces, three or four times a-day, or oftner, if
the stomach will bear it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>White Decoction.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the purest chalk, in powder, two ounces; gum
arabic, half an ounce; water, three pints. Boil to one
quart, and strain the decoction.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a proper drink in acute diseases, attended with, or
inclining to, a looseness, and where acidities abound in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_668'>668</span>stomach or bowels. It is peculiarly proper for children when
afflicted with sourness of the stomach, and for persons who
are subject to the heart-burn. It may be sweetened with
sugar, as it is used, and two or three ounces of simple cinnamon-water
added to it.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ounce of powdered chalk, mixed with two pints of
water, will occasionally supply the place of this decoction,
and also of the chalk julep.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>DRAUGHTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This is a proper form for exhibiting such medicines as
are intended to operate immediately, and which do not
need to be frequently repeated; as purges, vomits, and a
few others, which are to be taken at one dose. Where a
medicine requires to be used for any length of time, it is
better to make up a larger quantity of it at once, which
saves both trouble and expence.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Anodyne Draught.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of liquid laudanum, twenty-five drops; simple cinnamon
water, an ounce; common syrup, two drachms.
Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In excessive pain, where bleeding is not necessary, and in
great restlessness, this composing draught may be taken and
repeated occasionally.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Diuretic Draught.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the diuretic salt, two scruples; syrup of poppies,
two drachms; simple cinnamon-water and common water,
of each an ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>This draught is of service in an obstruction or deficiency
of urine.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Purging Draughts.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of manna, an ounce; soluble tartar, or Rochel
salt, from three to four drachms. Dissolve in three ounces
of boiling water; to which add Jamaica pepper water, half
an ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>As manna sometimes will not sit upon the stomach, an
ounce or ten drachms of the bitter purging salts, dissolved in
four ounces of water, may be taken instead of the above.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who cannot take salts may use the following
draught:</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_669'>669</span>Take of jalap in powder, a scruple; common water, an
ounce; aromatic tincture, six drachms. Rub the jalap
with twice its weight of sugar, and add to it the other ingredients.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Sweating Draught.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take spirit of Mindererus, two ounces; salt of hartshorn,
five grains; simple cinnamon-water, and syrup of poppies,
of each half an ounce. Make them into a draught.</p>

<p class='c008'>In recent colds and rheumatic complaints, this draught
is of service. To promote its effects, however, the patient
ought to drink freely of warm water-gruel, or of some other
weak diluting liquor.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vomiting Draughts.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of ipecacuanha, in powder, a scruple; water, an
ounce; simple syrup, a drachm. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>Persons who require a stronger vomit may add to the
above half a grain, or a grain, of emetic tartar.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who do not chuse the powder, may take ten
drachms of the ipecacuanha wine; or half an ounce of the
wine, and an equal quantity of the syrup of squills.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>ELECTUARIES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Electuaries are generally composed of the lighter
powders, mixed with syrup, honey, conserve, or mucilage,
into such a consistence, that the powders may neither
separate by keeping, nor the mass prove too stiff for swallowing.
They receive chiefly the milder alterative medicines,
and such as are not ungrateful to the palate.</p>

<p class='c008'>Astringent electuaries, and such as have pulps of fruit in
them, should be prepared only in small quantities; as astringent
medicines lose their virtues by being kept in this form,
and the pulps of fruits are apt to ferment.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the extraction of pulps it will be necessary to boil unripe
fruits, and ripe ones if they are dried, in a small quantity
of water till they become soft. The pulp is then to be
pressed out through a strong hair sieve, or thin cloth, and
afterwards boiled to a due consistence, in an earthen vessel,
over a gentle fire, taking care to prevent the matter from
burning by continually stirring it. The pulps of fruit that
are both ripe and fresh may be pressed out without any previous
boiling.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_670'>670</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Lenitive Electuary.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of senna, in fine powder, eight ounces; coriander
seed, also in powder, four ounces; pulp of tamarinds and
of French prunes, each a pound. Mix the pulps and powders
together, and with a sufficient quantity of simple syrup,
reduce the whole into an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tea-spoonful of this electuary, taken two or three times
a day, generally proves an agreeable laxative. It likewise
serves as a convenient vehicle for exhibiting more active
medicines, as jalaps, scammony, and such like.</p>

<p class='c008'>This may supply the place of the electuary of <i>Cassia</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary for the Dysentery.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the Japonic confection, two ounces; Locatelli’s
balsam, one ounce; rhubarb in powder, half an ounce;
syrup of marsh-mallows, enough to make an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is often dangerous in dysenteries to give opiates and
astringents, without interposing purgatives. The purgative
is here joined with these ingredients, which renders this a
very safe and useful medicine for the purposes expressed in
the title.</p>

<p class='c008'>About the bulk of a nutmeg should be taken twice or
thrice a-day, as the symptoms and constitution may require.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary for the Epilepsy.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Peruvian bark, in powder, an ounce; of powdered
tin, and wild valerian-root, each half an ounce; simple
syrup, enough to make an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Dr. Mead directs a drachm of an electuary similar to this
to be taken evening and morning, in the epilepsy, for the
space of three months. It will be proper, however, to discontinue
the use of it for a few days every now and then. I
have added the powdered tin, because the epilepsy often proceeds
from worms.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary for the Gonorrhœa.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of lenitive electuary, three ounces; jalap and rhubarb,
in powder, of each two drachms; nitre, half an ounce;
simple syrup, enough to make an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the inflammation and tension of the urinary passages,
which accompany a virulent gonorrhœa, this cooling
laxative may be used with advantage.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_671'>671</span>The dose is a drachm, or about the bulk of a nutmeg,
two or three times a-day; more or less, as may be necessary
to keep the body gently open.</p>

<p class='c008'>An electuary made of cream of tartar and simple syrup
will occasionally supply the place of this.</p>

<p class='c008'>After the inflammation is gone off, the following electuary
may be used:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of lenitive electuary, two ounces; balsam of capivi,
one ounce; gum guaiacum and rhubarb, in powder, of each
two drachms; simple syrup, enough to make an electuary.
The dose is the same as of the preceding.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary of the Bark.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Peruvian bark, in powder, three ounces; cascarilla,
half an ounce; syrup of ginger, enough to make an
electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the cure of obstinate intermitting fevers, the bark is
assisted by the cascarilla. In hectic habits, however, it will
be better to leave out the cascarilla, and put three drachms of
crude sal ammoniac in its stead.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary for the Piles.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take flowers of sulphur, one ounce; cream of tartar,
half an ounce; treacle, a sufficient quantity to form an
electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tea-spoonful of this may be taken three or four times
a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary for the Palsy.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of powdered mustard-seed, and conserve of roses,
each an ounce; syrup of ginger, enough to make an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>A tea-spoonful of this may be taken three or four times
a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Electuary for the Rheumatism.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of conserve of roses, two ounces; cinnabar of antimony,
levigated, an ounce and a half; gum guaiacum, in
powder, an ounce; syrup of ginger, a sufficient quantity to
make an electuary.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstinate rheumatisms, which are not accompanied
with a fever, a tea-spoonful of this electuary may be taken
twice a-day with considerable advantage.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_672'>672</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>EMULSIONS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Emulsions, beside their use as medicines, are also proper
vehicles for certain substances, which could not otherwise
be conveniently taken in a liquid form. Thus camphor,
triturated with almonds, readily unites with water
into an emulsion. Pure oils, balsams, resins, and other
similar substances, are likewise rendered miscible with water
by the intervention of mucilages.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Common Emulsion.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of sweet almonds, an ounce; bitter almonds, a
drachm; water, two pints.</p>

<p class='c008'>Let the almonds be blanched, and beat up in a marble
mortar; adding the water by little and little, so as to make
an emulsion; afterwards let it be strained.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Arabic Emulsion.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This is made in the same manner as the above, adding to
the almonds while beating, two ounces and a half of the
mucilage of gum arabic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where soft cooling liquors are necessary, these emulsions
may be used as ordinary drink.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Camphorated Emulsion.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of camphor, half a drachm; sweet almonds, half
a dozen; white sugar, half an ounce; mint-water, eight
ounces. Grind the camphor and almonds well together in
a stone mortar, and add by degrees the mint water; then
strain the liquor, and dissolve in it the sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fevers, and other disorders which require the use of
camphor, a table-spoonful of this emulsion may be taken
every two or three hours.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Emulsion of Gum Ammoniac.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum ammoniac, two drachms; water, eight
ounces. Grind the gum with the water poured upon it by
little and little, till it is dissolved.</p>

<p class='c008'>This emulsion is used for attenuating tough, viscid phlegm,
and promoting expectoration. In obstinate coughs, two
ounces of the syrup of poppies may be added to it. The
dose is two table-spoonfuls three or four times a-day.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_673'>673</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Oily Emulsion.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of soft water, six ounces; volatile aromatic spirit,
two drachms; Florence oil, an ounce; shake them well together,
and add, of simple syrup, half an ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>In recent colds and coughs, this emulsion is generally of
service; but if the cough proves obstinate, it will succeed
better when made with the paregoric elixir of the Edinburgh
Dispensatory, instead of the volatile aromatic spirit. A table-spoonful
of it may be taken every two or three hours.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>EXTRACTS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Extracts are prepared by boiling the subject in water,
and evaporating the strained decoction to a due consistence.
By this process some of the more active parts of
plants are freed from the useless, indissoluble earthy matter,
which makes the larger share of their bulk. Water, however,
is not the only menstruum used in the preparation of
extracts; sometimes it is joined with spirits, and at other
times rectified spirit alone is employed for that purpose.</p>

<p class='c008'>Extracts are prepared from a variety of different drugs, as
the bark, gentian, jalap, &#38;c.; but as they require a troublesome
and tedious operation, it will be more convenient
for a private practitioner to purchase what he needs of them
from a professed druggist, than to prepare them himself.
Such of them as are generally used are inserted in our list
of such drugs and medicines as are to be kept for private
practice.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>FOMENTATIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Fomentations are generally intended either to ease
pain, by taking off tension and spasm; or to brace and
restore the tone and vigour of those parts to which they are
applied. The first of these intentions may generally be
answered by warm water, and the second by cold. Certain
substances, however, are usually added to water, with a view
to heighten its effects, as anodynes, aromatics, astringents,
&#38;c. We shall therefore subjoin a few of the most useful
medicated fomentations, that people may have it in their
power to make use of them if they chuse.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_674'>674</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Anodyne Fomentation.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of white poppy-heads, two ounces; elder flowers,
half an ounce; water, three pints. Boil till one pint is
evaporated, and strain out the liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>This fomentation, as its title expresses, is used for relieving
acute pain.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Aromatic Fomentation.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Jamaica pepper, half an ounce; red wine, a
pint. Boil them for a little, and then strain the liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is intended, not only as a topical application for external
complaints, but also for relieving the internal parts.
Pains of the bowels, which accompany dysenteries and diarrhœas,
flatulent colics, uneasiness of the stomach, and reachings
to vomit, are frequently abated by fomenting the abdomen
and region of the stomach with the warm liquor.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Common Fomentation.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take tops of wormwood and camomile flowers, dried, of
each two ounces; water, two quarts. After a slight boiling,
pour off the liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>Brandy or spirit of wine may be added to this fomentation,
in such quantity as the particular circumstances of the case
shall require; but these are not always necessary.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Emollient Fomentation.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This is the same as the common decoction.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Strengthening Fomentation.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of oak bark, one ounce; granate peel, half an
ounce; alum, two drachms; smith’s forge water, three pints.
Boil the water with the bark and peel to the consumption of
one-third; then strain the remaining decoction, and dissolve
it in alum.</p>

<p class='c008'>This astringent liquor is employed as an external fomentation
to weak parts; it may also be used internally.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>GARGLES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>However trifling this class of medicines may appear,
they are by no means without their use. They seldom
indeed cure diseases, but they often alleviate very disagreeable
symptoms; as parchedness of the mouth, foulness of the
tongue and fauces, &#38;c. they are peculiarly useful in fevers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_675'>675</span>and sore throats. In the latter, a gargle will sometimes remove
the disorder; and in the former, few things are more
refreshing or agreeable to the patient, than to have his mouth
frequently washed with some soft detergent gargle.</p>

<p class='c008'>One advantage of these medicines is, that they are easily
prepared. A little barley-water and honey may be had any
where; and if to these be added as much vinegar as will give
them an agreeable sharpness, they will make a very useful
gargle for softening and cleansing the mouth.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gargles have the best effect when injected with a syringe.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Attenuating Gargle.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of water, six ounces; honey, one ounce; nitre, a
drachm and a half. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This cooling gargle may be used either in the inflammatory
quinsey, or in fevers, for cleaning the tongue and
fauces.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Common Gargle.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of rose-water, six ounces; syrup of clove July-flowers,
half an ounce; spirit of vitriol, a sufficient quantity
to give it an agreeable sharpness. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This gargle, besides cleansing the tongue and fauces, acts
as a gentle repellent, and will sometimes remove a slight
quinsey.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Detergent Gargle.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the emollient gargle, a pint; tincture of myrrh,
an ounce; honey, two ounces. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>When exulcerations require to be cleansed, or the excretion
of tough viscid saliva promoted, this gargle will be of
service.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Emollient Gargle.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take an ounce of marsh-mallow roots, and two or three
figs; boil them in a quart of water till near one half of it be
consumed; then strain out the liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>If an ounce of honey, and half an ounce of spirit of sal ammoniac,
be added to the above, it will then be an exceeding
good <i>attenuating gargle</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>This gargle is beneficial in fevers, where the tongue and
fauces are rough and parched, to soften these parts, and promote
the discharge of saliva.</p>

<p class='c008'>The learned and accurate Sir John Pringle observes, that
in the inflammatory quinsey, or strangulation of the fauces,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_676'>676</span>little benefit arises from the common gargles; that such as
are of an acid nature do more harm than good, by contracting
the emunctories of the saliva and mucus, and thickening
those humours; that a decoction of figs in milk and water
has a contrary effect, especially if some sal ammoniac be
added; by which the saliva is made thinner, and the glands
brought to secrete more freely; a circumstance always conducive
to the cure.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>INFUSIONS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Vegetables yield nearly the same properties to water
by infusion as by decoction; and though they may require
a longer time to give out their virtues in this way, yet
it has several advantages over the other; since boiling is
found to dissipate the finer parts of many bitter and aromatic
substances, without more fully extracting their medicinal
principles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The author of the New Dispensatory observes, that even
from those vegetables which are weak in virtue, rich infusions
may be obtained, by returning the liquor upon fresh
quantities of the subject, the water loading itself more and
more with the active parts; and that these loaded infusions
are applicable to valuable purposes in medicine, as they contain
in a small compass the finer, more subtile, and active
principles of vegetables, in a form readily miscible with the
fluids of the human body.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Bitter Infusion.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take tops of the lesser centaury and camomile flowers, of
each half an ounce; yellow rind of lemon and orange peel,
carefully freed from the inner white part, of each two
drachms. Cut them in small pieces, and infuse them in a
quart of boiling water.</p>

<p class='c008'>For indigestion, weakness of the stomach, or want of appetite,
a tea-cupful of this infusion may be taken twice or
thrice a day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Infusion of the Bark.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>To an ounce of the bark, in powder, add four or five
table-spoonfuls of brandy, and a pint of boiling water. Let
them infuse for two or three days.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is one of the best preparations of the bark for weak
stomachs. In disorders where the corroborating virtues of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_677'>677</span>that medicine are required, a tea-cupful of it may be taken
two or three times a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Infusion of Carduus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Infuse an ounce of the dried leaves of carduus benedictus,
or blessed thistle, in a pint of common water, for six hours,
without heat; then filter the liquor through paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>This light infusion may be given, with great benefit, in
weakness of the stomach, where the common bitters do not
agree. It may be flavoured at pleasure with cinnamon, or
other aromatic materials.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Infusion of Linseed.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of linseed, two spoonfuls; liquorice root, sliced,
half an ounce; boiling water, three pints. Let them stand
to infuse by the fire for some hours, and then strain off the
liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>If an ounce of the leaves of colt’s foot be added to these
ingredients, it will then be the <i>pectoral infusion</i>. Both these
are emollient mucilaginous liquors, and may be taken with
advantage as ordinary drink in difficulty of making water;
and in coughs and other complaints of the breast.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Infusion of Roses.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of red roses, dried, half an ounce; boiling water,
a quart; vitriolic acid, commonly called oil of vitriol, half
a drachm; loaf sugar, an ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infuse the roses in the water for four hours, in an unglazed
earthen vessel; afterwards pour in the acid, and having
strained the liquor, add to it the sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an excessive flow of the <i>menses</i>, vomiting of blood, and
other hæmorrhages, a tea-cupful of this gently astringent
infusion may be taken every three or four hours. It likewise
makes an exceeding good gargle.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the quantity of roses used here can have little or no
effect, an equally valuable medicine may be prepared by
mixing the acid and water without infusion.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Infusion of Tamarinds and Senna.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of tamarinds, one ounce; senna, and crystals of
tartar, each two drachms. Let these ingredients be infused
four or five hours in a pint of boiling water; afterwards let
the liquor be strained, and an ounce or two of the aromatic
tincture added to it. Persons who are easily purged may
leave out either the tamarinds or the crystals of tartar.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_678'>678</span>This is an agreeable cooling purge. A tea-cupful may
be given every half hour till it operates.</p>

<p class='c008'>This supplies the place of the <i>decoction of tamarinds and
senna</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Spanish Infusion.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Spanish juice, cut into small pieces, an ounce;
salt of tartar, three drachms. Infuse in a quart of boiling
water for a night. To the drained liquor add an ounce and
a half of the syrup of poppies.</p>

<p class='c008'>In recent colds, coughs, and obstructions of the breast, a
tea-cupful of this infusion may be taken with advantage three
or four times a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Infusion for the Palsy.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of horse-radish root shaved, mustard-seed bruised,
each four ounces; outer rind of orange-peel, one ounce.
Infuse them in two quarts of boiling water, in a close vessel,
for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>In paralytic complaints, a tea-cupful of this warm stimulating
medicine may be taken three or four times a-day. It
excites the action of the solids, proves diuretic, and, if the
patient be kept warm, promotes perspiration.</p>

<p class='c008'>If two or three ounces of the dried leaves of marsh-trefoil
be used instead of the mustard, it will make the <i>antiscorbutic
infusion</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>JULEPS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The basis of juleps is generally common water, or some
simple distilled water, with one-third or one-fourth its
quantity of distilled spirituous water, and as much sugar or
syrup as is sufficient to render the mixture agreeable. This
is sharpened with vegetable or mineral acids, or impregnated
with other medicines suitable to the intention.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Camphorated Julep.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of camphor, one drachm; rectified spirit of wine,
ten drops; double refined sugar, half an ounce; boiling
distilled water, one pint. Rub the camphor first with the
spirit of wine, then with the sugar; lastly, add the water
by degrees, and strain the liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_679'>679</span>In hysterical and other complaints where camphor is proper,
this julep may be taken in the dose of a spoonful or two
as often as the stomach will bear it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Cordial Julep.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of simple cinnamon-water, four ounces; Jamaica
pepper water, two ounces; volatile aromatic spirit, and
compound spirit of lavender, of each two drachms; syrup
of orange-peel, an ounce. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is given in the dose of two spoonfuls three or four
times a day, in disorders accompanied with great weakness
and depression of spirits.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Expectorating Julep.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the emulsion of gum ammoniac, six ounces;
syrup of squills, two ounces. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In coughs, asthmas, and obstructions of the breast, two
table-spoonfuls of this julep may be taken every three or four
hours.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Musk Julep.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Rub half a drachm of musk well together with half an
ounce of sugar, and add to it, gradually, of simple cinnamon
and peppermint water, each two ounces; of the volatile
aromatic spirit, two drachms.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the low state of nervous fevers, hiccuping, convulsions,
and other spasmodic affections, two table-spoonfuls of this
julep may be taken every two or three hours.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Saline Julep.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dissolve two drachms of salt of tartar in three ounces of
fresh lemon-juice, strained; when the effervescence is over,
add, of mint-water, and common water, each two ounces;
of simple syrup, one ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>This removes sickness at the stomach, relieves vomiting,
promotes perspiration, and may be of some service in fevers,
especially of the inflammatory kind.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vomiting Julep.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dissolve four grains of emetic tartar in eight ounces of
water; and add to it half an ounce of the syrup of clove
July flowers.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the beginning of fevers, where there is no topical inflammation,
this julep may be given in the dose of one table-spoonful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_680'>680</span>every quarter of an hour till it operates. Antimonial
vomits serve not only to evacuate the contents of the
stomach, but likewise to promote the different excretions.
Hence they are found in fevers to have nearly the same effects
as Dr. <i>James’s Powder</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>MIXTURES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A mixture differs from a julep in this respect, that it
receives into its composition not only salts, extracts,
and other substances dissoluble in water, but also earths,
powders, and such substances as cannot be dissolved. A
mixture is seldom either an elegant or agreeable medicine.
It is nevertheless necessary. Many persons can take a mixture,
who are not able to swallow a bolus or an electuary:
besides, there are medicines which act better in this than in
any other form.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Astringent Mixture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take simple cinnamon-water and common water, of each
three ounces; spirituous cinnamon-water, an ounce and a
half; Japonic confection, half an ounce. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In dysenteries which are not of long standing, after the
necessary evacuations, a spoonful or two of this mixture may
be taken every four hours, interposing every second or third
day a dose of rhubarb.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Diuretic Mixture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of mint-water, five ounces; vinegar of squills, six
drachms; sweet spirit of nitre, half an ounce; syrup of ginger,
an ounce and a half. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstructions of the urinary passages, two spoonfuls of
this mixture may be taken twice or thrice a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Laxative Absorbent Mixture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Rub one drachm of magnesia alba in a mortar with ten or
twelve grains of the best Turkey rhubarb, and add to them
three ounces of common water; simple cinnamon-water,
and syrup of sugar, of each one ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>As most diseases of infants are accompanied with acidities,
this mixture may either be given with a view to correct these,
or to open the body. A table-spoonful may be taken for a
dose, and repeated three times a-day. To a very young
child half a spoonful will be sufficient.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_681'>681</span>When the mixture is intended to purge, the dose may
either be increased, or the quantity of rhubarb doubled.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is one of the most generally useful medicines for
children with which I am acquainted.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Saline Mixture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dissolve a drachm of the salt of tartar in four ounces of
boiling water; and, when cold, drop into it spirit of vitriol
till the effervescence ceases; then add, of peppermint-water,
two ounces, simple syrup, one ounce.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where fresh lemons cannot be had, this mixture may occasionally
supply the place of the saline julep.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Squill Mixture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of simple cinnamon-water, five ounces; vinegar of
squills, one ounce; syrup of marsh-mallows, an ounce and
a half. Mix them.</p>

<p class='c008'>This mixture, by promoting expectoration, and the secretion
of urine, proves serviceable in asthmatic and dropsical
habits. A table-spoonful of it may be taken frequently.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>OINTMENTS, LINIMENTS, and CERATES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Notwithstanding the extravagant encomiums which
have been bestowed on different preparations of this
kind, with regard to their efficacy in the cure of wounds,
sores, &#38;c. it is beyond a doubt, that the most proper application
to a green wound is dry lint. But though ointments
do not heal wounds and sores, yet they serve to defend them
from the external air, and to retain such substances as may be
necessary for drying, deterging, destroying proud flesh, and
such like. For these purposes, however, it will be sufficient
to insert only a few of the most simple forms, as ingredients
of a more active nature can occasionally be added to them.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Yellow Basilicum Ointment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of yellow wax, white resin, and frankincense, each
a quarter of a pound; melt them together over a gentle fire;
then add, of hogs’ lard prepared, one pound. Strain the
ointment while warm.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ointment is employed for cleansing and healing
wounds and ulcers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_682'>682</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Ointment of Calamine.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of olive oil, a pint and a half; white wax, and calamine
stone levigated, of each half a pound. Let the calamine
stone, reduced into a fine powder, be rubbed with some
part of the oil, and afterwards added to the rest of the oil and
wax, previously melted together, continually stirring them
till quite cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ointment, which is commonly known by the name
of <i>Turner’s Cerate</i>, is an exceeding good application in burns
and excoriations, from whatever cause.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Emollient Ointment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of palm oil, two pounds; olive oil, a pint and a
half; yellow wax, half a pound; Venice turpentine, a quarter
of a pound. Melt the wax in the oils over a gentle fire;
then mix in the turpentine, and strain the ointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>This supplies the place of <i>Althæ Ointment</i>. It may be
used for anointing inflamed parts, &#38;c.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Eye Ointment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of hogs’ lard prepared, four ounces; white wax,
two drachms; tutty prepared, one ounce; melt the wax with
the lard over a gentle fire, and then sprinkle in the tutty,
continually stirring them till the ointment is cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ointment will be more efficacious, and of a better
confidence, if two or three drachms of camphor be rubbed
up with a little oil, and intimately mixed with it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Another.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of camphor, and calamine stone levigated, each six
drachms; verdegrise well prepared, two drachms; hogs’ lard,
and mutton suet prepared, of each two ounces. Rub the
camphor well with the powder; afterwards mix in the lard
and suet, continuing the triture till they be perfectly united.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ointment has been long in esteem for diseases of the
eyes. It ought, however, to be used with caution, when
the eyes are much inflamed or very tender.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Issue Ointment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Mix half an ounce of Spanish flies, finely powdered, in
six ounces of yellow basilicum ointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ointment is chiefly intended for dressing blisters, in
order to keep them open during pleasure.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_683'>683</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Ointment of Lead.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of olive oil, half a pint; white wax, two ounces;
sugar of lead, three drachms. Let the sugar of lead, reduced
into a fine powder, be rubbed up with some part of the
oil, and afterwards added to the other ingredients, previously
melted together, continually stirring them till quite
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>This cooling and gently astringent ointment may be used
in all cases where the intention is to dry and skin over the
part, as in scalding, &#38;c.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Mercurial Ointment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of quicksilver, two ounces; hogs’ lard, three ounces;
mutton suet, one ounce. Rub the quicksilver with an ounce
of the hogs’ lard in a warm mortar, till the globules be perfectly
extinguished; then rub it up with the rest of the lard
and suet, previously melted together.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal intention of this ointment is to convey
mercury into the body by being rubbed upon the skin.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Ointment of Sulphur.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of hogs’ lard prepared, four ounces; flowers of sulphur,
an ounce and a half; crude sal ammoniac, two
drachms; essence of lemon, ten or twelve drops. Make
them into an ointment.</p>

<p class='c008'>This ointment, rubbed upon the parts affected, will generally
cure the itch. It is both the safest and best application
for that purpose, and, when made in this way, has no disagreeable
smell.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>White Ointment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of olive oil, one pint; white wax and sperma-ceti,
of each three ounces. Melt them with a gentle heat, and
keep them constantly and briskly stirring together, till quite
cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>If two drachms of camphor, previously rubbed with a
small quantity of oil, be added to the above, it will make the
<i>White camphorated Ointment</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Liniment for Burns.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take equal parts of Florence oil, or of fresh drawn linseed
oil, and lime-water; shake them well together in a wide
mouthed bottle, so as to form a liniment.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_684'>684</span>This is found to be an exceeding proper application for
recent scalds or burns. It may either be spread upon a cloth,
or the parts affected may be anointed with it twice or thrice
a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>White Liniment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This is made in the same manner as the white ointment,
two-thirds of the wax being left out.</p>

<p class='c008'>This liniment may be applied in cases of excoriation,
where, on account of the largeness of the surface, the ointments
with lead or calamine might be improper.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Liniment for the Piles.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of emollient ointment, two ounces; liquid laudanum,
half an ounce. Mix these ingredients with the yolk
of an egg, and work them well together.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Volatile Liniment.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Florence oil, an ounce; spirit of hartshorn, half
an ounce. Shake them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>This liniment, made with equal parts of the spirit and oil,
will be more efficacious, where the patient’s skin is able to
bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>Sir John Pringle observes, that in the inflammatory
quinsey, a piece of flannel, moistened with this liniment,
and applied to the throat, to be renewed every four or five
hours, is one of the most efficacious remedies; and that it
seldom fails, after bleeding, either to lessen or carry off the
complaint. The truth of this observation I have often experienced.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Camphorated Oil.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Rub an ounce of camphor, with two ounces of Florence
oil, in a mortar, till the camphor be entirely dissolved.</p>

<p class='c008'>This antispasmodic liniment may be used in obstinate rheumatisms,
and in some other cases accompanied with extreme
pain and tension of the parts.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PILLS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Medicines which operate in a small dose, and whose
disagreeable taste, or smell, makes it necessary that
they should be concealed from the palate, are most commodiously
exhibited in this form. No medicine, however, that
is intended to operate quickly, ought to be made into pills,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_685'>685</span>as they often lie for a considerable time on the stomach before
they are dissolved, so as to produce any effect.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the ingredients which enter the composition of pills are
generally so contrived, that one pill of an ordinary size may
contain about five grains of the compound, in mentioning
the dose we shall only specify the number of pills to be
taken; as one, two, three, &#38;c.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Composing Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of purified opium, ten grains; Castile soap, half a
drachm. Beat them together, and form the whole into
twenty pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>When a quieting draught will not sit upon the stomach,
one, two, or three of these pills may be taken, as occasion
requires.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Fœtid Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of asafœtida, half an ounce; simple syrup, as much
as is necessary to form it into pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>In hysteric complaints, four or five pills, of an ordinary
size, may be taken twice or thrice a-day. They may likewise
be of service to persons afflicted with the asthma.</p>

<p class='c008'>When it is necessary to keep the body open, a proper
quantity of rhubarb, aloes, or jalap, may occasionally be
added to the above mass.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Hemlock Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take any quantity of the extract of hemlock, and adding
to it about a fifth part its weight of the powder of the dried
leaves, form it into pills of the ordinary size.</p>

<p class='c008'>The extract of hemlock may be taken from one grain to
several drachms in the day. The best method, however, of
using these pills, is to begin with one or two, and to increase
the dose gradually, as far as the patient can bear them, without
any remarkable degree of stupor or giddiness.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Mercurial Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of purified quicksilver and honey, each half an
ounce. Rub them together in a mortar, till the globules of
mercury are perfectly extinguished; then add, of Castile
soap, two drachms, powdered liquorice, or crumb of bread,
a sufficient quantity to give the mass a proper consistence for
pills.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_686'>686</span>When stronger mercurial pills are wanted, the quantity
of quicksilver may be doubled.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose of these pills is different, according to the intention
with which they are given. As an alterant, two or
three maybe taken daily. To raise a salivation, four or five
will be necessary.</p>

<p class='c008'>Equal parts of the above pill and powdered rhubarb made
into a mass, with a sufficient quantity of simple syrup, will
make a <i>Mercurial purging Pill</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Mercurial sublimate Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dissolve fifteen grains of the corrosive sublimate of mercury
in two drachms of the saturated solution of crude sal
ammoniac, and make it into a paste, in a glass mortar, with
a sufficient quantity of the crumb of bread. This mass must
be formed into one hundred and twenty pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>This pill, which is the most agreeable form of exhibiting
the sublimate, has been found efficacious, not only in curing
the venereal disease, but also in killing and expelling <i>worms</i>,
after other powerful medicines had failed<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c010'><sup>[209]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>For the venereal disease, four of these pills may be taken
twice a-day, as an alterant three, and for worms two.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Plummer’s Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of calomel, or sweet mercury, and precipitated sulphur
of antimony, each three drachms; extract of liquorice,
two drachms. Rub the sulphur and mercury well together;
afterwards add the extract, and, with a sufficient
quantity of the mucilage of gum arabic, make them into
pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>This pill has been found a powerful, yet safe, alterative
in obstinate cutaneous disorders; and has completed a cure
after salivation had failed. In venereal cases it has likewise
produced excellent effects. Two or three pills of an ordinary
size may be taken night and morning, the patient
keeping moderately warm, and drinking after each dose a
draught of decoction of the woods, or of sarsaparilla.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_687'>687</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Purging Pills.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of succotorine aloes, and Castile soap, each two
drachms; of simple syrup, a sufficient quantity to make them
into pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>Four or five of these pills will generally prove a sufficient
purge. For keeping the body gently open, one may be taken
night and morning. They are reckoned both deobstruent
and stomachic, and will be found to answer all the purposes
of Dr. Anderson’s pills, the principal ingredient of which
is aloes.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where aloetic purges are improper, the following pills
may be used:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take extract of jalap, and vitriolated tartar, of each two
drachms; syrup of ginger, as much as will make them of a
proper consistence for pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>These pills may be taken in the same quantity as the above.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Pill for the Jaundice.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Castile soap, succotorine aloes, and rhubarb, of
each one drachm. Make them into pills with a sufficient
quantity of syrup or mucilage.</p>

<p class='c008'>These pills, as their title expresses, are chiefly intended
for the jaundice, which, with the assistance of proper diet,
they will often cure. Five or six of them may be taken
twice a-day, more or less, as is necessary to keep the body
open. It will be proper, however, during their use, to
interpose now and then a vomit of ipecacuanha or tartar
emetic.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Stomachic Pill.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take extract of gentian, two drachms; powdered rhubarb
and vitriolated tartar, of each one drachm; oil of mint,
thirty drops; simple syrup, a sufficient quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>Three or four of these pills may be taken twice a-day, for
invigorating the stomach, and keeping the body gently open.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Squill Pills.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take powder of dried squills, a drachm and a half; gum
ammoniac, and cardamom seeds, in powder, of each three
drachms; simple syrup, a sufficient quantity.</p>

<p class='c008'>In dropsical and asthmatic complaints, two or three of
these pills may be taken twice a-day, or oftner, if the stomach
will bear them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_688'>688</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Strengthening Pill.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take soft extract of the bark, and salt of steel, each a
drachm. Make into pills.</p>

<p class='c008'>In disorders arising from excessive debility, or relaxation
of the solids, as the <i>chlorosis</i>, or green-sickness, two of these
pills may be taken three times a-day.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>PLASTERS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Plasters ought to be of a different consistence, according
to the purposes for which they are intended. Such
as are to be applied to the breasts or stomach ought to be soft
and yielding; while those designed for the limbs should be
firm and adhesive.</p>

<p class='c008'>It has been supposed, that plasters might be impregnated
with the virtues of different vegetables, by boiling the recent
vegetable with the oil employed for the composition of
the plaster; but this treatment does not communicate to the
oils any valuable qualities.</p>

<p class='c008'>The <i>calces</i> of lead boiled with oils unite with them into
a plaster of a proper consistence, which make the basis of
several other plasters. In boiling these compositions, a
quantity of hot water must be added from time to time to
prevent the plaster from burning or growing black. This,
however, should be done with care, lest it cause the matter
to explode.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Common Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of common olive oil, six pints; litharge reduced to
a fine powder, two pounds and a half. Boil the litharge
and oil together over a gentle fire, continually stirring them,
and keeping always about half a gallon of water in the vessel:
after they have boiled about three hours, a little of the
plaster may be taken out and put into cold water, to try if
it be of a proper consistence: when that is the case, the
whole may be suffered to cool, and the water well pressed
out of it with the hands.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plaster is generally applied in slight wounds and excoriations
of the skin. It keeps the part soft and warm, and
defends it from the air, which is all that is necessary in such
cases. Its principal use, however, is to serve as a basis for
other plasters.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_689'>689</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Adhesive Plaster.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of common plaster, half a pound; of Burgundy
pitch, a quarter of a pound. Melt them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plaster is principally used for keeping on other
dressings.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Anodyne Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Melt an ounce of adhesive plaster, and, when it is cooling,
mix with it a drachm of powdered opium, and the same
quantity of camphor, previously rubbed up with a little oil.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plaster generally gives ease in acute pains, especially
of the nervous kind.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Blistering Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Venice turpentine, six ounces; yellow wax, two
ounces; Spanish flies in fine powder, three ounces; powdered
mustard, one ounce. Melt the wax, and while it is
warm, add to it the turpentine, taking care not to evaporate
it by too much heat. After the turpentine and wax are sufficiently
incorporated, sprinkle in the powders, continually
stirring the mass till it be cold.</p>

<p class='c008'>Though this plaster is made in a variety of ways, one seldom
meets with it of a proper consistence. When compounded
with oils and other greasy substances, its effects are
blunted, and it is apt to run; while pitch and resin render it
too hard and very inconvenient.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the blistering plaster is not at hand, its place may
be supplied by mixing with any soft ointment a sufficient
quantity of powdered flies; or by forming them into a paste
with flour and vinegar.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Gum Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the common plaster, four pounds; gum ammoniac
and galbanum, strained, of each half a pound. Melt
them together, and add, of Venice turpentine, six ounces.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plaster is used as a digestive, and likewise for discussing
indolent tumours.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Mercurial Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of common plaster, one pound; of gum ammoniac,
strained, half a pound. Melt them together, and, when
cooling, add eight ounces of quicksilver, previously extinguished
by triture, with three ounces of hog’s lard.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_690'>690</span>This plaster is recommended in pains of the limbs arising
from a venereal cause. Indurations of the glands, and other
violent tumours, are likewise found sometimes to yield to it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Stomach Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum plaster, half a pound; camphorated oil, an
ounce and a half; black pepper, or capsicum, where it can
be had, one ounce. Melt the plaster, and mix with it the
oil; then sprinkle in the pepper, previously reduced to a fine
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>An ounce or two of this plaster, spread upon soft leather,
and applied to the region of the stomach, will be of service
in flatulencies arising from hysteric and hypochondriac affections.
A little of the expressed oil of mace, or a few drops
of the essential oil of mint, may be rubbed upon it before it
is applied.</p>

<p class='c008'>This may supply the place of the <i>Anti-hysteric Plaster</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Warm Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum plaster, one ounce; blistering plaster, two
drachms. Melt them together over a gentle fire.</p>

<p class='c008'>This plaster is useful in the sciatica and other fixed pains
of the rheumatic kind: it ought, however, to be worn for
some time, and to be renewed, at least, once a-week. If
this is found to blister the part, which is sometimes the case,
it must be made with a smaller proportion of the blistering
plaster.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Wax Plaster.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of yellow wax, one pound; white resin, half a
pound; mutton suet, three quarters of a pound. Melt them
together.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is generally used instead of the <i>Melilot Plaster</i>. It
is a proper application after blisters, and in other cases
where a gentle digestive is necessary.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>POWDERS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>This is one of the most simple forms in which medicine
can be administered. Many medicinal substances, however,
cannot be reduced into powder, and others are too disagreeable
to be taken in this form.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_691'>691</span>The lighter powders may be mixed in any agreeable thin
liquor, as tea or water-gruel. The more ponderous will require
a more consistent vehicle, as syrup, conserve, jelly, or
honey.</p>

<p class='c008'>Gums, and other substances which are difficult to powder,
should be pounded along with the drier ones; but those which
are too dry, especially aromatics, ought to be sprinkled during
their pulverization with a few drops of any proper water.</p>

<p class='c008'>Aromatic powders are to be prepared only in small quantities
at a time, and kept in glass vessels closely stopped. Indeed,
no powders ought to be exposed to the air or kept
too long, otherwise their virtues will be in great measure
destroyed.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Astringent Powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of alum and Japan earth, each two drachms. Pound
them together, and divide the whole into ten or twelve
doses.</p>

<p class='c008'>In an immoderate flow of the <i>menses</i>, and other hæmorrhages,
one of these powders may be taken every hour, or
every half hour, if the discharge be violent.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Powder of Bole.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of bole armenic, or French bole, two ounces; cinnamon,
one ounce; tormentil root and gum arabic, of each
six drachms; long pepper, one drachm. Let all these ingredients
be reduced into a powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>This warm, glutinous astringent powder, is given in
fluxes, and other disorders where medicines of that class are
necessary, in the dose of a scruple, or half a drachm.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a drachm of opium be added, it will make the <i>Powder of
Bole with Opium</i>, which is a medicine of considerable efficacy.
It may be taken in the same quantity as the former, but not
above twice or thrice a day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Carminative Powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of coriander-seed, half an ounce; ginger, one
drachm; nutmegs, half a drachm; fine sugar, a drachm
and a half. Reduce them into powder for twelve doses.</p>

<p class='c008'>This powder is employed for expelling flatulencies arising
from indigestion, particularly those to which hysteric and
hypochondriac persons are so liable. It may likewise be
given in small quantities to children in their food, when
troubled with gripes.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_692'>692</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Diuretic Powder.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum arabic, four ounces; purified nitre, one
ounce. Pound them together, and divide the whole into
twenty-four doses.</p>

<p class='c008'>During the first stage of the venereal disease, one of these
cooling powders may be taken three times a-day, with considerable
advantage.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Aromatic Opening Powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the best Turkey rhubarb, cinnamon, and fine
sugar, each two drachms. Let the ingredients be pounded,
and afterwards mixed well together.</p>

<p class='c008'>Where flatulency is accompanied with costiveness, a tea-spoonful
of this powder may be taken once or twice a-day,
according to circumstances.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Saline Laxative Powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of soluble tartar, and cream of tartar, each one
drachm; purified nitre, half a drachm. Make them into a
powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>In fevers, and other inflammatory disorders, where it is
necessary to keep the body gently open, one of these cooling
laxative powders may be taken in a little gruel, and repeated
occasionally.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Steel Powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take filings of steel, and loaf-sugar, of each two ounces;
ginger, two drachms. Pound them together.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstructions of the <i>menses</i>, and other cases where steel
is proper, a tea-spoonful of this powder may be taken twice
a-day, and washed down with a little wine or water.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Sudorific Powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take purified nitre and vitriolated tartar of each half an
ounce; opium and ipecacuanha, of each one drachm. Mix
the ingredients, and reduce them to a fine powder.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is generally known by the name of <i>Dover’s Powder</i>.
It is a powerful sudorific. In obstinate rheumatisms, and
other cases where it is necessary to excite a copious sweat,
this powder may be administered in the dose of a scruple or
half a drachm. Some patients will require two scruples. It
ought to be accompanied with the plentiful use of some
warm diluting liquor.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_693'>693</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Worm-powders.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of tin reduced into a fine powder, an ounce;
Æthiop’s mineral, two drachms. Mix them well together,
and divide the whole into six doses.</p>

<p class='c008'>One of these powders may be taken in a little syrup, honey,
or treacle, twice a-day. After they have been all used,
the following anthelmintic purge may be proper.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Purging Worm-powder.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of powdered rhubarb, a scruple; scammony and
calomel, of each five grains. Rub them together in a mortar
for one dose.</p>

<p class='c008'>For children the above doses must be lessened according to
their age.</p>

<p class='c008'>If the powder of tin be given alone, its dose may be considerably
increased. The late Dr. Alston gave it to the
amount of two ounces in three days, and says, when thus
administered, that it proved an egregious anthelmintic. He
purged his patients both before they took the powder and
afterwards.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Powder for the Tape-worm.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Early in the morning the patient is to take in any liquid,
two or three drachms, according to his age and constitution,
of the root of the male fern reduced into a fine
powder. About two hours afterwards, he is to take of
calomel and resin of scammony, each ten grains; gum
gamboge, six grains. These ingredients must be finely
powdered and given in a little syrup, honey, treacle, or
any thing that is most agreeable to the patient. He is then
to walk gently about, now and then drinking a dish of
weak green tea, till the worm is passed. If the powder of
the fern produces nausea, or sickness, it may be removed by
sucking the juice of an orange or lemon.</p>

<p class='c008'>This medicine, which had been long kept a secret abroad
for the cure of the tape-worm, was some time ago purchased
by the French King, and made public for the benefit of mankind.
Not having had an opportunity of trying it, I can
say nothing from experience concerning its efficacy. It seems,
however, from its ingredients, to be an active medicine, and
ought to be taken with care. The dose here prescribed is
sufficient for the strongest patient; it must, therefore, be reduced
according to the age and constitution.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_694'>694</span>
  <h4 class='c017'>SYRUPS.</h4>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Syrups were some time ago looked upon as medicines of
considerable value. They are at present, however, regarded
chiefly as vehicles for medicines of greater efficacy,
and are used for sweetening draughts, juleps, or mixtures;
and for reducing the lighter powders into boluses, pills, and
electuaries. As all these purposes may be answered by the
simple syrup alone, there is little occasion for any other;
especially as they are seldom found but in a state of fermentation;
and as the dose of any medicine given in this form
is very uncertain. Persons who serve the public must keep
whatever their customers call for; but to the private practitioner
nine-tenths of the syrups usually kept in the shops
are unnecessary.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Simple Syrup</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Is made by dissolving in water, either with or without
heat, about double its weight of fine sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>If twenty-five drops of laudanum be added to an ounce
of the simple syrup, it will supply the place of diacodium,
or the syrup of poppies, and will be found a more safe and
certain medicine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The lubricating virtues of the syrup of marsh-mallows may
likewise be supplied, by adding to the common syrup a sufficient
quantity of mucilage of gum arabic.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who chuse to preserve the juice of lemons in form
of syrup, may dissolve in it, by the heat of a warm bath,
nearly double its weight of fine sugar. The juice ought to
be previously strained, and suffered to stand till it settles.</p>

<p class='c008'>The syrup of ginger is sometimes of use as a warm vehicle
for giving medicines to persons afflicted with flatulency. It
may be made by infusing two ounces of bruised ginger in two
pints of boiling water for twenty-four hours. After the
liquor has been strained, and has stood to settle for some time,
it may be poured off, and a little more than double its weight
of fine powdered sugar dissolved in it.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>TINCTURES, ELIXIRS, &#38;c.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Rectified spirit is the direct menstruum of the resins
and essential oils of vegetables, and totally extracts these
active principles from sundry substances, which yield them to
water, either not at all, or only in part.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_695'>695</span>It dissolves likewise those parts of animal substances in
which their peculiar smells and tastes reside. Hence the
tinctures prepared with rectified spirits form an useful and
elegant class of medicines, possessing many of the most essential
virtues of simples, without being clogged with their
inert or useless parts.</p>

<p class='c008'>Water, however, being the proper menstruum of the
gummy, saline, and saccharine parts of medicinal substances,
it will be necessary, in the preparation of several tinctures,
to make use of a weak spirit, or a composition of rectified
spirit and water.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Aromatic Tincture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Infuse two ounces of Jamaica pepper in two pints of
brandy, without heat, for a few days; then strain off the
tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This simple tincture will sufficiently answer all the intentions
of the more costly preparations of this kind. It is
rather too hot to be taken by itself; but is very proper for
mixing with such medicines as might otherwise prove too
cold for the stomach.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Compound Tincture of the Bark.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Peruvian bark, two ounces; Seville orange-peel
and cinnamon, of each half an ounce. Let the bark be
powdered, and the other ingredients bruised; then infuse
the whole in a pint and a half of brandy, for five or six days,
in a close vessel; afterwards strain off the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This tincture is not only beneficial in intermitting fevers,
but also in the slow, nervous, and putrid kinds, especially
towards their decline.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is from one drachm to three or four, every fifth
or sixth hour. It may be given in any suitable liquor, and
occasionally sharpened with a few drops of the spirit of
vitriol.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Volatile Fœtid Tincture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Infuse two ounces of asafœtida in one pint of volatile
aromatic spirit, for eight days, in a close bottle, frequently
shaking it; then strain the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This medicine is beneficial in hysteric disorders, especially
when attended with lowness of spirits, and faintings. A
tea-spoonful of it may be taken in a glass of wine, or a cup
of penny-royal tea.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_696'>696</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Volatile Tincture of Gum Guaiacum.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum guaiacum, four ounces; volatile aromatic
spirit, a pint. Infuse without heat, in a vessel well stopped,
for a few days; then strain off the tincture<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c010'><sup>[210]</sup></a>.</p>

<p class='c008'>In rheumatic complaints, a tea-spoonful of this tincture
may be taken in a cup of the infusion of water-trefoil, twice
or thrice a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Tincture of Black Hellebore.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Infuse two ounces of the roots of black hellebore, bruised,
in a pint of proof spirit, for seven or eight days; then filter
the tincture through paper. A scruple of cochineal may be
infused along with the roots, to give the tincture a colour.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstructions of the <i>menses</i>, a tea-spoonful of this tincture
may be taken in a cup of camomile or penny-royal tea
twice a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Astringent Tincture.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Digest two ounces of gum kino, in a pint and a half of
brandy, for eight days; afterwards strain it for use.</p>

<p class='c008'>This tincture, though not generally known, is a good
astringent medicine. With this view, an ounce, or more,
of it may be taken three or four times a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Tincture of Myrrh and Aloes.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gum myrrh, an ounce and a half; hepatic aloes,
one ounce. Let them be reduced to a powder, and infused
in two pints of rectified spirits, for six days, in a gentle
heat; then strain the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is principally used by surgeons for cleansing foul
ulcers, and restraining the progress of gangrenes. It is also,
by some, recommended as a proper application to green
wounds.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Tincture of Opium, or Liquid Laudanum.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of crude opium, two ounces; spirituous aromatic
water, and mountain wine, of each ten ounces. Dissolve
the opium, sliced, in the wine, with a gentle heat, frequently
stirring it; afterwards add the spirit, and strain off
the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_697'>697</span>As twenty-five drops of this tincture contain about a grain
of opium, the common dose may be from twenty to thirty
drops.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Sacred Tincture, or Tincture of Hiera Picra.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of succotorine aloes in powder, one ounce; Virginian
snake-root and ginger, of each two drachms. Infuse
in a pint of mountain wine, and half a pint of brandy, for
a week, frequently shaking the bottle, then strain off the
tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a safe and useful purge for persons of a languid and
phlegmatic habit; but is thought to have better effects,
taken in small doses as a laxative.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose, as a purge, is from one to two ounces.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Compound Tincture of Senna.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of senna, one ounce; jalap, coriander seeds, and
cream of tartar, of each half an ounce. Infuse them in a
pint and a half of French brandy for a week; then strain
the tincture, and add to it four ounces of fine sugar.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is an agreeable purge, and answers all the purposes
of the <i>Elixir salutis</i>, and of <i>Daffy’s Elixir</i>.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is from one to two or three ounces.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Tincture of Spanish Flies.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Spanish flies, reduced to a fine powder, two
ounces; spirit of wine, one pint. Infuse for two or three
days; then strain off the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is intended as an acrid stimulant for external use.
Parts affected with the palsy or chronic rheumatism may be
frequently rubbed with it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Tincture of the Balsam of Tolu.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the balsam of Tolu, an ounce and a half; rectified
spirit of wine, a pint. Infuse in a gentle heat until
the balsam is dissolved; then strain the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This tincture possesses all the virtues of the balsam. In
coughs, and other complaints of the breast, a tea-spoonful
or two of it may be taken in a bit of loaf-sugar. But the
best way of using it is in syrup. An ounce of the tincture,
properly mixed with two pounds of simple syrup, will make
what is commonly called the <i>Balsamic Syrup</i>.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_698'>698</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Tincture of Rhubarb.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of rhubarb, two ounces and a half; lesser cardamom
seeds, half an ounce; brandy, two pints. Digest for
a week, and strain the tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>Those who chuse to have a vinous tincture of rhubarb
may infuse the above ingredients in a bottle of Lisbon wine,
adding to it about two ounces of proof spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>If half an ounce of gentian root, and a drachm of Virginian
snake-root be added to the above ingredients, it will
make the bitter tincture of rhubarb.</p>

<p class='c008'>All these tinctures are designed as stomachics and corroborants
as well as purgatives. In weakness of the stomach,
indigestion, laxity of the intestines, fluxes, colicky and such
like complaints, they are frequently of great service. The
dose is from half a spoonful to three or four spoonfuls or
more, according to the circumstances of the patient, and
the purposes it is intended to answer.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Paregoric Elixir.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of flowers of benzoin, half an ounce; opium, two
drachms. Infuse in one pound of the volatile aromatic
spirit, for four or five days, frequently shaking the bottle;
afterwards strain the elixir.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is an agreeable and safe way of administering opium.
It eases pain, allays tickling coughs, relieves difficult breathing,
and is useful in many disorders of children, particularly
the hooping cough.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose to an adult is from fifty to a hundred drops.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Sacred Elixir.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of rhubarb cut small, ten drachms; succotorine
aloes, in powder, six drachms; lesser cardamom seeds, half
an ounce; French brandy, two pints. Infuse for two or
three days, and then strain the elixir.</p>

<p class='c008'>This useful stomachic purge may be taken from one ounce
to an ounce and a half.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Stomachic Elixir.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gentian root, two ounces; Curassao oranges,
one ounce; Virginian snake-root, half an ounce. Let the
ingredients be bruised, and infused for three or four days in
two pints of French brandy; afterwards, strain out the elixir.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_699'>699</span>This is an elegant stomachic bitter. In flatulencies, indigestion,
want of appetite, and such like complaints, a
small glass of it may be taken twice a-day. It likewise relieves
the gout in the stomach, when taken in a large dose.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Acid Elixir of Vitriol.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of the aromatic tincture, one pint; oil of vitriol,
three ounces. Mix them gradually, and after the fæces
have subsided, filter the elixir through paper, in a glass
funnel.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is one of the best medicines which I know for hysteric
and hypochondriac patients, afflicted with flatulencies
arising from relaxation or debility of the stomach and intestines.
It will succeed where the most celebrated stomachic
bitters have no effect. The dose is from ten to forty
drops, in a glass of wine or water, or a cup of any bitter infusion,
twice or thrice a-day. It should be taken when the
stomach is most empty.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Camphorated Spirit of Wine.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dissolve an ounce of camphor in a pint of rectified
spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>This solution is chiefly employed as an embrocation in
bruises, palsies, the chronic rheumatism, and for preventing
gangrenes.</p>

<p class='c008'>The above quantity of camphor, dissolved in half a pound
of the volatile aromatic spirit, makes <i>Ward’s Essence</i>.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Spirit of Mindererus.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of volatile sal ammoniac, any quantity. Pour on it
gradually distilled vinegar, till the effervescence ceases.</p>

<p class='c008'>This medicine is useful in promoting a discharge both by
the skin and urinary passages. It is also a good external application
in strains and bruises.</p>

<p class='c008'>When intended to raise a sweat, half an ounce of it in a
cup of warm gruel may be given to the patient in bed every
hour till it has the desired effect.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>VINEGARS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>Vinegar is an acid produced from vinous liquors by
a second fermentation. It is an useful medicine both
in inflammatory and putrid disorders. Its effects are, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_700'>700</span>cool the blood, quench thirst, counteract a tendency to putrefaction,
and allay inordinate motions of the system. It
likewise promotes the natural secretions, and in some cases
excites a copious sweat, where the warm medicines, called
alexipharmic, tend rather to prevent that salutary evacuation.</p>

<p class='c008'>Weakness, faintings, vomitings, and other hysteric affections,
are often relieved by vinegar applied to the mouth and
nose, or received into the stomach. It is of excellent use
also in correcting many poisonous substances, when taken
into the stomach; and in promoting their expulsion, by the
different emunctories, when received into the blood.</p>

<p class='c008'>Vinegar is not only an useful medicine, but serves likewise
to extract, in tolerable perfection, the virtues of several
other medicinal substances. Most of the odoriferous flowers
impart to it their fragrance, together with a beautiful purplish
or red colour. It also assists or coincides with the intention
of squills, garlic, gum ammoniac, and several other
valuable medicines.</p>

<p class='c008'>These effects, however, are not to be expected from every
thing that is sold under the name of vinegar, but from such
as is sound and well prepared.</p>

<p class='c008'>The best vinegars are those prepared from French wines.</p>

<p class='c008'>It is necessary for some purposes that the vinegar be distilled;
but as this operation requires a particular chemical
apparatus, we shall not insert it.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vinegar of Litharge.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of litharge, half a pound; strong vinegar, two
pints. Infuse them together in a moderate heat for three
days, frequently shaking the vessel; then filter the liquor for
use.</p>

<p class='c008'>This medicine is little used, from a general notion of its
being dangerous. There is reason, however, to believe, that
the preparations of lead with vinegar are possessed of some
valuable properties, and that they may be used in many cases
with safety and success.</p>

<p class='c008'>A preparation of a similar nature with the above has of
late been extolled by Goulard, a French surgeon, as a safe
and extensively useful medicine, which he calls the <i>Extract
of Saturn</i>, and orders to be made in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of litharge, one pound; vinegar made of French
wine, two pints. Put them together into a glazed earthen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_701'>701</span>pipkin, and let them boil, or rather simmer, for an hour,
or an hour and a quarter, taking care to stir them all the
while with a wooden spatula. After the whole has stood to
settle, pour off the liquor which is upon the top into bottles
for use.</p>

<p class='c008'>With this extract Goulard makes his <i>vegeto-mineral water</i><a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c010'><sup>[211]</sup></a>,
which he recommends in a great variety of external
disorders, as inflammations, burns, bruises, sprains, ulcers,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>He likewise prepares with it a number of other forms of
medicine, as poultices, plasters, ointments, powders, &#38;c.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vinegar of Roses.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of red roses, half a pound; strong vinegar, half a
gallon. Infuse in a close vessel for several weeks, in a
gentle heat; and then strain off the liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is principally used as an embrocation for head-achs,
&#38;c.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Vinegar of Squills.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of dried squills, two ounces; distilled vinegar, two
pints. Infuse for ten days or a fortnight in a gentle degree
of heat, afterwards strain off the liquor, and add to it about
a twelfth part its quantity of proof spirits.</p>

<p class='c008'>This medicine has good effects in disorders of the breast,
occasioned by a load of viscid phlegm. It is also of use in
hydropic cases for promoting a discharge of urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is from two drachms to two ounces, according to
the intention for which it is given. When intended to act
as a vomit, the dose ought to be large. In other cases, it
must not only be exhibited in small doses, but also mixed with
cinnamon water, or some other agreeable aromatic liquor,
to prevent the nausea it might otherwise occasion.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WATERS BY INFUSION, &#38;c.</h4>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Lime-Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Pour two gallons of water gradually upon a pound of
fresh burnt quicklime; and when the ebullition ceases,
stir them well together; then suffer the whole to stand at
rest, that the lime may settle, and afterwards filter the liquor
through paper, which is to be kept in vessels closely
stopt.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_702'>702</span>The lime-water from calcined oyster-shells, is prepared
in the same manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Lime-water is principally used for the gravel; in which
case, from a pint to two or more of it may be drunk daily.
Externally it is used for washing foul ulcers, and removing
the itch, and other diseases of the skin.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Compound Lime-Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take shavings of guaiacum wood, half a pound; liquorice
root, one ounce; sassafras bark, half an ounce; coriander
seeds, three drachms; simple lime-water, six pints.</p>

<p class='c008'>Infuse without heat for two days, and then strain off the
liquor.</p>

<p class='c008'>In the same manner may lime-water be impregnated with
the virtues of other vegetable substances. Such impregnation
not only renders the water more agreeable to the palate, but
also a more efficacious medicine, especially in cutaneous disorders,
and foulness of the blood and juices.</p>

<p class='c008'>It may be taken in the same quantity as the simple water.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Sublimate Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Dissolve eight grains of the corrosive sublimate in a pint
of cinnamon water.</p>

<p class='c008'>If a stronger solution is wanted, a double or triple quantity
of sublimate may be used.</p>

<p class='c008'>The principal intention of this is to cleanse foul ulcers,
and consume proud flesh.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Styptic Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of blue vitriol and alum, each an ounce and a half;
water, one pint. Boil them until the salts are dissolved,
then filter the liquor, and add to it a drachm of the oil of
vitriol.</p>

<p class='c008'>This water is used for stopping a bleeding at the nose, and
other hæmorrhages; for which purpose cloths or dossils dipt
in it must be applied to the part.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Tar Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Pour a gallon of water on two pounds of Norway tar,
and stir them strongly together with a wooden rod: after
they have stood to settle for two days, pour off the water for
use.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_703'>703</span>Though tar-water falls greatly short of the character
which has been given of it, yet it possesses some medicinal
virtues. It sensibly raises the pulse, increases the secretions,
and sometimes opens the body, or occasions vomiting.</p>

<p class='c008'>A pint of it may be drank daily, or more, if the stomach
can bear it. It is generally ordered to be taken on an empty
stomach, viz. four ounces morning and evening, and the
same quantity about two hours after breakfast and dinner.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SIMPLE DISTILLED WATERS.</h4>

<p class='c018'>A great number of distilled waters were formerly kept
in the shops, and are still retained in some Dispensatories.
But we consider them chiefly in the light of grateful
diluents, suitable vehicles for medicines of greater efficacy,
or for rendering disgustful ones more agreeable to the palate
and stomach. We shall therefore insert only a few of those
which are best adapted to these intentions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The management of a still being now generally understood,
it is needless to spend time in giving directions for that
purpose.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Cinnamon Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Steep one pound of cinnamon bark, bruised, in a gallon
and a half of water, and one pint of brandy, for two days;
and then distil off one gallon.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is an agreeable aromatic water, possessing in a high
degree the fragrance and cordial virtues of the spice.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Pennyroyal Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of penny-royal leaves, dried, a pound and a half;
water, from a gallon and a half to two gallons. Draw off
by distillation one gallon.</p>

<p class='c008'>This water possesses, in a considerable degree, the smell,
taste, and virtues of the plant. It is given in mixtures and
juleps to hysteric patients.</p>

<p class='c008'>An infusion of the herb, in boiling water answers nearly
the same purposes.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Peppermint Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This is made in the same manner as the preceding.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Spearmint Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This may also be prepared in the same way as the penny-royal
water.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_704'>704</span>Both these are useful stomachic waters, and will sometimes
relieve vomiting, especially when it proceeds from indigestion,
or cold viscid phlegm. They are likewise useful
in some colicky complaints, the gout in the stomach, &#38;c.
particularly the peppermint water.</p>

<p class='c008'>An infusion of the fresh plant is frequently found to have
the same effects as the distilled water.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Rose Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of roses fresh gathered, six pounds; water, two
gallons. Distil off one gallon.</p>

<p class='c008'>This water is principally valued on account of its fine
flavour.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Jamaica Pepper Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Jamaica pepper, half a pound; water, a gallon
and a half. Distil off one gallon.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a very elegant distilled water, and may in most
cases supply the place of the more costly spice waters.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>SPIRITUOUS DISTILLED WATERS.</h4>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Spirituous Cinnamon Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of cinnamon bark, one pound; proof spirit, and
common water, of each one gallon. Steep the cinnamon
in the liquor for two days; then distil off one gallon.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Spirituous Jamaica Pepper Water.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Jamaica pepper, half a pound; proof spirit, three
gallons; water, two gallons. Distil off three gallons.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a sufficiently agreeable cordial, and may supply the
place of the <i>Aromatic Water</i>.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WHEYS.</h4>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Alum Whey.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Boil two drachms of powdered alum in a pint of milk till
it is curdled; then strain out the whey.</p>

<p class='c008'>This whey is beneficial in an immoderate flow of the <i>menses</i>,
and in a <i>diabetes</i>, or excessive discharge of urine.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is two, three, or four ounces, according as the
stomach will bear it, three times a-day. If it should occasion
vomiting, it may be diluted.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_705'>705</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Mustard-Whey.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take milk and water, of each a pint; bruised mustard-seed,
an ounce and a half. Boil them together till the curd
is perfectly separated; afterwards strain the whey through a
cloth.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is the most elegant, and by no means the least efficacious
method of exhibiting mustard. It warms and invigorates
the habit, and promotes the different secretions.
Hence, in the low state of nervous fevers, it will often supply
the place of wine. It is also of use in the chronic rheumatism,
palsy, dropsy, &#38;c. The addition of a little sugar
will render it more agreeable.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is an ordinary tea-cupful four or five times a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Scorbutic Whey.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>This whey is made by boiling half a pint of the scorbutic
juices in a quart of cow’s milk. More benefit, however, is
to be expected from eating the plants, than from their expressed
juices.</p>

<p class='c008'>The scorbutic plants are, bitter oranges, brooklime, garden
scurvy-grass, and water-cresses.</p>

<p class='c008'>A number of other wheys may be prepared nearly in the
same manner, as orange whey, cream of tartar whey, &#38;c.
These are cooling pleasant drinks in fevers, and may be rendered
cordial, when necessary, by the addition of wine.</p>

<h4 class='c017'>WINES.</h4>

<p class='c018'>The effects of wine are, to raise the pulse, promote perspiration,
warm the habit, and exhilarate the spirits.
The red wines, besides these effects, have an astringent quality,
by which they strengthen the tone of the stomach and
intestines, and by this means prove serviceable in restraining
immoderate secretions.</p>

<p class='c008'>The thin sharp wines have a different tendency. They
pass off freely by the different emunctories, and gently open
the body. The effects of the full bodied wines are, however,
much more durable than those of the thinner.</p>

<p class='c008'>All sweet wines contain a glutinous substance, and do not
pass off freely. Hence they will heat the body more than an
equal quantity of any other wine, though it should contain
fully as much spirit.</p>

<p class='c008'><span class='pageno' id='Page_706'>706</span>From the obvious qualities of wine, it must appear to be
an excellent cordial medicine. Indeed, to say the truth, it
is worth all the rest put together.</p>

<p class='c008'>But to answer this character, it must be sound and good.
No benefit is to be expected from the common trash that is
often sold by the name of wine, without possessing one drop
of the juice of the grape. Perhaps no medicine is more
rarely obtained genuine than wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>Wine is not only used as a medicine, but is also employed
as a <i>menstruum</i> for extracting the virtues of other medicinal
substances; for which it is not ill adapted, being a compound
of water, inflammable spirit, and acid; by which means it is
enabled to act upon vegetable and animal substances, and also
to dissolve some bodies of the metallic kind, so as to impregnate
itself with their virtues, as steel, antimony, &#38;c.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Anthelmintic Wine.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of rhubarb, half an ounce; worm-seed, an ounce.
Bruise them, and infuse without heat in two pints of red port
wine for a few days, then strain off the wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>As the stomachs of persons afflicted with worms are always
debilitated, red wine alone will often prove serviceable: it
must, however, have still better effects when joined with
bitter and purgative ingredients, as in the above form.</p>

<p class='c008'>A glass of this wine may be taken twice or thrice a-day.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Antimonial Wine.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take glass of antimony, reduced to a fine powder, half an
ounce; Lisbon wine, eight ounces. Digest, without heat,
for three or four days, now and then shaking the bottle; afterwards
filter the wine through paper.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose of this wine varies according to the intention.
As an alterative and diaphoretic, it may be taken from ten
to fifty or sixty drops. In a larger dose it generally proves
cathartic, or excites vomiting.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Bitter Wine.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of gentian root, yellow rind of lemon-peel, fresh,
each one ounce; long pepper, two drachms; mountain
wine, two pints. Infuse without heat for a week, and strain
out the wine for use.</p>

<p class='c008'>In complaints arising from weakness of the stomach, or
indigestion, a glass of this wine may be taken an hour before
dinner and supper.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_707'>707</span>
  <h5 class='c017'><i>Ipecacuanha Wine.</i></h5>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Take of ipecacuanha, in powder, one ounce; mountain
wine, a pint. Infuse for three or four days; then filter the
tincture.</p>

<p class='c008'>This is a safe vomit, and answers extremely well for such
persons as cannot swallow the powder, or whose stomachs are
too irritable to bear it.</p>

<p class='c008'>The dose is from one ounce to an ounce and a half.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Chalybeate or Steel Wine.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take filings of iron, two ounces; cinnamon and mace,
of each two drachms; Rhenish wine, two pints. Infuse for
three or four weeks, frequently shaking the bottle; then
pass the wine through a filter.</p>

<p class='c008'>In obstructions of the <i>menses</i>, this preparation of iron
may be taken, in the dose of half a wine-glass twice or thrice
a-day.</p>

<p class='c008'>The medicine would probably be as good if made with
Lisbon wine, sharpened with half an ounce of the cream of
tartar, or a small quantity of the vitriolic acid.</p>

<h5 class='c017'><i>Stomach Wine.</i></h5>

<p class='c018'>Take of Peruvian bark, grossly powdered, an ounce;
cardamom seeds, and orange peel, bruised, of each two
drachms. Infuse in a bottle of white port or Lisbon wine
for five or six days; then drain off the wine.</p>

<p class='c008'>This wine is not only of service in debility of the stomach
and intestines, but may also be taken as a preventive, by
persons liable to the intermittent fever, or who reside in
places where this disease prevails. It will be of use likewise
to those who recover slowly after fevers of any kind, as it
assists digestion, and helps to restore the tone and vigour of
the system.</p>

<p class='c008'>A glass of it may be taken two or three times a-day.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Although terms of art have been sedulously avoided
in the composition of this treatise, it is impossible entirely
to banish technical phrases when writing on medicine,
a science that has been less generally attended to by mankind,
and continues therefore to be more infected with the
jargon of the schools, than perhaps any other. Several persons
having expressed their opinion that a Glossary would
make this work more generally intelligible, the following
concise explanation of the few terms of art that occur, has
been added in compliance with their sentiments, and to fulfil
the original intention of this treatise, by rendering it intelligible

<p class='c008'><a href='#r3'>3</a>. Many advantages would arise to society, as well as to individuals,
from mothers suckling their own children. It would
prevent the temptation which poor women are laid under of abandoning
their children to suckle those of the rich for the sake of
gain: by which means society loses many of its most useful members,
and mothers become in some sense the murderers of their
own offspring. I am sure I speak within the truth when I say,
that not one in twenty of those children live, who are thus abandoned
by their mothers. For this reason no mother should be
allowed to suckle another’s child, till her own is either dead, or
fit to be weaned. A regulation of this kind would save many
lives among the poorer sort, and could do no hurt to the rich, as
most women who make good nurses are able to suckle two children
in succession upon the same milk.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f4'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r4'>4</a>. Tacitus, the celebrated Roman historian, complains greatly of
the degeneracy of the Roman ladies in his time, with regard to the
care of their offspring. He says that, in former times, the greatest
women in Rome used to account it their chief glory to keep the
house and attend their children; but that now the young infant was
committed to the sole care of some poor Grecian wench, or other
menial servant.—We are afraid, wherever luxury and effeminacy
prevail, there will be too much ground for this complaint.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f5'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r5'>5</a>. The common opinion, that the diseases of infants are hard
to discover and difficult to cure, has deterred many physicians from
paying that attention to them which they deserve. I can, however,
from experience declare, that this opinion is without foundation;
and that the diseases of infants are neither so difficult to discover,
nor so ill to cure, as those of adults.</p>
</div>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r6'>6</a>. Rousseau.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f7'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r7'>7</a>. The Lacedemonians condemned their king Archidamus for
having married a weak, puny woman; because, said they, instead
of propagating a race of heroes, you will fill the throne with a
progeny of changelings.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f8'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r8'>8</a>. The Jews, by their laws, were, in certain cases, forbid to
have any manner of commerce with the diseased; and indeed to
this all wise legislators ought to have a special regard. In some
countries, diseased persons have actually been forbid to marry.
This is an evil of a complicated kind, a natural deformity, and
political mischief; and therefore requires a public consideration.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f9'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r9'>9</a>. A friend of mine, who was several years on the coast of
Africa, tells me, that the natives neither put any clothes upon
their children, nor apply to their bodies bandages of any kind,
but lay them on a pallet, and suffer them to tumble about at pleasure;
yet they are all strait, and seldom have any disease.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f10'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r10'>10</a>. This is by no means inveighing against a thing that does not
happen. In many parts of Britain at this day, a roller, eight or
ten feet in length, is applied tightly round the child’s body as soon
as it is born.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f11'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r11'>11</a>. Stays made of bend-leather are worn by all the women of
lower station in many parts of England.</p>

<p class='c008'>I am sorry to understand, that there are still mothers mad
enough to lace their daughters very tight in order to improve
their shape. As reasoning would be totally lost upon such people,
I shall beg leave just to ask them, Why there are ten deformed
women for one man? and likewise to recommend to their perusal
a short moral precept, which forbids us to <i>deform the human
body</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f12'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r12'>12</a>. Children are always sickly in the fruit season, which may
be thus accounted for: Two-thirds of the fruit which comes to
market in this country is really unripe; and children not being
in a condition to judge for themselves, eat whatever they can
lay their hands upon, which often proves little better than a
poison to their tender bowels. Servants, and others who have
the care of children, should be strictly forbid to give them any
fruit without the knowledge of their parents.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f13'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r13'>13</a>. The nurse ought to be careful to keep the child in a proper
position; as deformity is often the consequence of inattention to
this circumstance. Its situation ought also to be frequently
changed. I have known a child’s legs bent all on one side, by
the nurse carrying it constantly on one arm.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f14'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r14'>14</a>. If it were made the interest of the poor to keep their children
alive, we should lose very few of them. A small premium
given annually to each poor family, for every child they have
alive at the year’s end, would save more infant lives than if the
whole revenue of the crown were expended on hospitals for this
purpose. This would make the poor esteem fertility a blessing;
whereas many of them think it the greatest curse that can befal
them; and in place of wishing their children to live, so far does
poverty get the better of natural affection, that they are often
very happy when they die.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f15'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r15'>15</a>. It is undoubtedly the duty of parents to instruct their children,
at least till they are of an age proper to take some care of
themselves. This would tend much to confirm the ties of parental
tenderness and filial affection, of the want of which there
are at present so many deplorable instances. Though few fathers
have time to instruct their children, yet most mothers
have; and surely they cannot be better employed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f16'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r16'>16</a>. I am happy to find that the masters of academies now begin
to put in practice this advice. Each of them ought to keep a
drill serjeant for teaching the boys the military exercise. This,
besides contributing to their health and vigour of body, would
have many other happy effects.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f17'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r17'>17</a>. I have been told that in China, where the police is the best
in the world, all the children are employed in the easier part
of gardening and husbandry; as weeding, gathering stones off
the land, and such like.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f18'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r18'>18</a>. It is amazing how children escape suffocation, considering
the manner in which they are often rolled up in flannels, &#38;c.
I lately attended an infant, whom I found muffled up over
head and ears in many folds of flannel, though it was in the
middle of June. I begged for a little free air to the poor babe;
but though this indulgence was granted during my stay, I found
it always on my return in the same situation. Death, as might be
expected, soon freed the infant from all its miseries; but it was
not in my power to free the minds of its parents from those
prejudices which proved fatal to their child.</p>

<p class='c008'>I was very lately called to see an infant which was said to be
expiring in convulsion fits. I desired the mother to strip the
child, and wrap it in a loose covering. It had no more convulsion
fits.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f19'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r19'>19</a>. I have often known people so imposed upon, as to give an
infant to a nurse to be suckled who had not one drop of milk in
her breast.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f20'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r20'>20</a>. If a mother on visiting her child at nurse find it always
asleep, I would advise her to remove it immediately; otherwise
it will soon sleep its last.</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f22'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r22'>22</a>. When persons heated with labour have drank cold liquor,
they ought to continue at work for some time after.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f23'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r23'>23</a>. It is indeed to be regretted, that soldiers suffer not less from
indolence and intemperance in time of peace, than from hardships
in time of war. If men are idle they will be vicious. It
would therefore be of great importance, could a scheme be formed
for rendering the military, in times of peace, both more healthy
and more useful. These desirable objects might, in our opinion,
be obtained, by employing them for some hours every day, and
advancing their pay accordingly. By this means, idleness, the
mother of vice, might be prevented, the price of labour lowered,
public works, as harbours, canals, turnpike roads, &#38;c. might be
made without hurting manufactures; and soldiers might be enabled
to marry, and bring up children. A scheme of this kind
might easily be conducted, so as not to depress the martial spirit,
provided the men were only to work four or five hours every day,
and always to work without doors: no soldier should be suffered to
work too long, or to follow any sedentary employment. Sedentary
employments render men weak and effeminate, quite unfit
for the hardships of war: whereas working for a few hours every
day without doors would inure them to the weather, brace their
nerves, and increase their strength and courage.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f24'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r24'>24</a>. Our countryman, the celebrated Captain <span class='sc'>Cook</span>, has shewn
how far, by proper care and attention, the diseases formerly so
fatal to seamen may be prevented. In a voyage of three years
and eighteen days, during which he was exposed to every climate,
from the 52° north to the 71° of south latitude, of one hundred
and eighteen men composing the ship’s company, he lost only
one, who died of a <i>phthisis pulmonalis</i>. The principal means he
used were, to preserve a strict attention to cleanliness, to procure
abundance of vegetables and fresh provisions, especially
good water, and to allow his people sufficient time for rest.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f25'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r25'>25</a>. The appellation of sedentary has generally been given only
to the studious; we can see no reason, however, for restricting it
to them alone. Many artificers may, with as much propriety,
be denominated sedentary as the studious, with this particular
disadvantage, that they are often obliged to sit in very awkward
postures, which the studious need not do, unless they please.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f26'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r26'>26</a>. A person of observation in that line of life told me, that
most taylors die of consumptions; which he attributed chiefly to
the unfavourable postures in which they sit, and the unwholesomeness
of those places where their business is carried on. If
more attention was not paid to profit than to the preservation of
human lives, this evil might be easily remedied; but while
masters only mind their own interest, nothing will be done for
the safety of their servants.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f27'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r27'>27</a>. The poor, indeed, are generally the first who suffer by unsound
provisions; but the lives of the labouring poor are of great
importance to the state: besides, diseases occasioned by unwholesome
food often prove infectious, by which means they reach
people in every station. It is therefore the interest of all to take
care that no spoilt provisions of any kind be exposed to sale.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f28'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r28'>28</a>. In most eastern countries it was customary to bury the dead
at some distance from any town. As this practice obtained among
the Jews, the Greeks, and also the Romans, it is strange that
the western parts of Europe should not have followed their example
in a custom so truly laudable.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f29'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r29'>29</a>. One cannot pass through a large church or cathedral, even
in summer, without feeling quite chilly.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f30'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r30'>30</a>. We have daily accounts of persons who lose their lives by
going down into deep wells and other places where the air stagnates;
all these accidents might be prevented by only letting
down a lighted candle before them, and stopping when they perceive
it go out; yet this precaution, simple as it is, is seldom used.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f31'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r31'>31</a>. A year seldom passes that we do not hear of some hospital
physician or surgeon having lost his life by an hospital fever
caught from his patients. For this they have themselves alone
to blame. Their patients are either in an improper situation,
or they are too careless with regard to their own conduct.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f32'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r32'>32</a>. It is not necessity, but fashion, which makes the use of carriages
so common. There are many people who have not exercise
enough to keep their humours wholesome, who yet dare not
venture to make a visit to their next neighbours, but in a coach
or sedan, lest they should be looked down upon. Strange, that
men should be such fools as to be laughed out of the use of their
limbs, or to throw away their health, in order to gratify a piece
of vanity, or to comply with a ridiculous fashion!</p>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f34'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r34'>34</a>. Sedentary occupations ought chiefly to be followed by women.
They bear confinement much better than men, and are
fitter for every kind of business which does not require much
strength. It is ridiculous enough to see a lusty fellow making
pins, needles, or watch-wheels, while many of the laborious parts
of husbandry are carried on by the other sex. The fact is, we
want men for laborious employments, while one half of the
other sex are rendered useless for want of occupations suited to
their strength, &#38;c. Were girls bred to mechanical employments,
we should not see such numbers of them prostitute themselves
for bread, nor find such a want of men for the important
purposes of navigation, agriculture, &#38;c. An eminent silk manufacturer
told me, that he found women answer better for that
business, than men; and that he had lately taken a great many
girls apprentices as silk-weavers. I hope his example will be
followed by many others.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f35'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r35'>35</a>. Golff is a diversion very common in North Britain. It is
well calculated for exercising the body, and may always be taken
in such moderation, as neither to overheat nor fatigue. It has
greatly the preference over cricket, tennis, or any of those games
which cannot be played without violence.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f36'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r36'>36</a>. Men of every occupation, and in every situation of life,
have lived to a good old age; nay some have enjoyed this blessing
whose plan of living was by no means regular: but it consists
with observation, that all very old men have been early
risers. This is the only circumstance attending longevity, to
which I never knew an exception.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f37'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r37'>37</a>. <i>That colds kill more than plagues</i>, is an old observation; and,
with regard to this country, it holds strictly true. Every person
of discernment, however, will perceive, that most of the colds
which prove so destructive to the inhabitants of Britain are owing
to their imprudence in changing clothes. A few warm days in
March or April induce them to throw off their winter garments,
without considering that our most penetrating colds generally
happen in the spring.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f38'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r38'>38</a>. This madness seems to have pervaded the minds of mothers
in every age and country. Terence, in his Comedy of the
Eunuch, ridicules the Roman matrons for attempting to mend
the shape of their daughters.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f39'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r39'>39</a>. We often see persons, who are rendered quite lame by the
nails of their toes having grown into the flesh, and frequently
hear of mortifications proceeding from this cause. All these,
and many other inconveniences attending the feet, must be imputed
solely to the use of short and strait shoes.</p>

by cold save fools and beggars; the latter not being able to procure
clothes, and the former not having sense to wear them. Be
this as it may, I can with the strictest truth declare, that in many
cases where the powers of medicine had been tried in vain, I have
cured the patient by recommending thick shoes, a flannel waistcoat
and drawers, a pair of under stockings, or a flannel petticoat,
to be worn during the cold season at least.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r43'>43</a>. We may form some notion of the immense quantity of ardent
spirits consumed in Great Britain from this circumstance, that in
the city of Edinburgh and its environs, besides the great quantity
of foreign spirits duly entered, and the still greater quantity
which is supposed to be smuggled, it is computed that above two
thousand private stills are constantly employed in preparing a
poisonous liquor called <i>Molasses</i>. The common people have got
so universally into the habit of drinking this base spirit, that when
a porter or labourer is seen reeling along the streets, they say, <i>he
has got molassed</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f44'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r44'>44</a>. It is amazing that our improvements in arts, learning, and
politeness, have not put the barbarous custom of drinking to excess
out of fashion. It is indeed less common in South Britain
than it was formerly; but it still prevails very much in the North,
where this relic of barbarity is mistaken for hospitality. There
no man is supposed to entertain his guests well, who does not
make them drunk. Forcing people to drink, is certainly the
greatest piece of rudeness that any man can be guilty of. Manliness,
complaisance, or mere good-nature, may induce a man to
take his glass, if urged to it, at a time when he might as well take
poison. The custom of drinking to excess has long been out of
fashion in France; and, as it begins to lose ground among the
politer part of the English, we hope it will soon be banished from
every part of this island.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r45'>45</a>. Mr. Pot, in his surgical observations, mentions a disease which
he calls the chimney-sweeper’s cancer, as it is almost peculiar to
that unhappy set of people. This he attributes to neglect of cleanliness,
and with great justice. I am convinced, that if that part
of the body which is the seat of this cruel disease was kept clean
by frequent walking, it would never happen. The climbing boys,
as they are called, are certainly the most miserable wretches on
the face of the earth; yet, for cleaning chimnies, no such persons
are necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f46'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r46'>46</a>. In ancient Rome the greatest men did not think cleanliness
an object unworthy of their attention. Pliny says, the <i>Cloacæ</i>, or
common sewers for the conveyance of filth and nastiness from the
city, were the greatest of all the public works; and bestows higher
encomiums upon Tarquinius, Agrippa, and others who made
and improved them, than on those who achieved the greatest conquests.</p>

<p class='c008'>How truly great does the emperor Trajan appear, when giving
directions to Pliny his proconsul, concerning the making of a

<p class='c008'><a href='#r48'>48</a>. As it is impossible to be thoroughly clean without a sufficient
quantity of water, we would earnestly recommend it to the magistrates
of great towns to be particularly attentive to this article.
Most great towns in Britain are so situated as to be easily supplied
with water; and those persons who will not make a proper use of
it, after it is brought to their hand, certainly deserve to be severely
punished. The streets of great towns, where water can be
had, ought to be washed every day. This is the only effectual
method for keeping them thoroughly clean; and, upon trial, we
are persuaded it will be found the cheapest.</p>

<p class='c008'>Some of the most dreadful diseases incident to human nature
might, in my opinion, be entirely eradicated by cleanliness.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f49'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r49'>49</a>. Were the tenth part of the care taken to prevent the importation
of diseases, that there is to prevent smuggling, it would be
attended with many happy consequences. This might easily be
done by appointing a physician at every considerable sea-port,
to inspect the ship’s company, passengers, &#38;c. before they came
ashore, and, if any fever or other infectious disorder prevailed, to
order the ship to perform a short quarantine, and to send the sick
to some hospital or proper place to be cured. He might likewise
order all the clothes, bedding, &#38;c. which had been used by the
sick during the voyage, to be either destroyed, or thoroughly
cleansed by fumigation, &#38;c. before any of it were sent ashore.
A scheme of this kind, if properly conducted, would prevent
many fevers, and other infectious diseases, from being brought
by sailors into sea-port towns, and by this means diffused all over
the country.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f50'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r50'>50</a>. There is reason to believe that infection is often conveyed
from one place to another by the carelessness of the faculty themselves.
Many physicians affect a familiar way of sitting upon the
patient’s bedside, and holding his arm for a considerable time. If
the patient has the small-pox, or any other infectious disease,
there is no doubt but the doctor’s hands, clothes, &#38;c. will carry
away some of the infection; and, if he goes directly to visit another
patient without washing his hands, changing his clothes,
or being exposed to the open air, which is not seldom the case,
is it any wonder that he should carry the disease along with him?
Physicians not only endanger others, but also themselves, by this
practice. And indeed they sometimes suffer for their want of
care.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f51'>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r52'>52</a>. The conduct of parents with regard to the disposal of their
children in marriage is often very blamable. An advantageous
match is the constant aim of parents; while their children often
suffer a real martyrdom betwixt their inclinations and duty. The
first thing which parents ought to consult in disposing their children
in marriage, is certainly their inclinations. Were due regard
always paid to these, there would be fewer unhappy couples,
and parents would not have so often cause to repent the severity
of their conduct, after a ruined constitution, a lost character, or
a distracted mind, has shewn them their mistake.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f53'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r53'>53</a>. It has long been an observation among physicians, that the
appearances of the urine are very uncertain, and very little to be
depended on. No one will be surprised at this who considers how
many ways it may be affected, and consequently have its appearance
altered. The passions, the state of the atmosphere, the quantity
and quality of the food, the exercise, the clothing, the state
of the other evacuations, and numberless other causes, are sufficient
to induce a change either in the quantity or appearance of the urine.
Any one who attends to this, will be astonished at the impudence
of those daring quacks, who pretend to find out diseases, and prescribe
to patients from the bare inspection of their urine. These
impostors, however, are very common all over Britain, and by
the amazing credulity of the populace, many of them amass considerable
fortunes. Of all the medical prejudices which prevail in
this country, that in favour of <i>urine doctors</i> is the strongest. The
common people have still an unlimited faith in their skill, although
it has been demonstrated that no one of them is able to
distinguish the urine of a horse, or any other animal, from that
of a man.</p>

of the weather in this country, than happened while I was writing
these notes. This morning, August 14, 1783, the thermometer
in the shade was down at fifty-three degrees, and a very
few days ago it stood above eighty. No one who reflects on such
great and sudden changes in the atmosphere, will be surprised to
find colds, coughs, rheums, with other affections of the breast and
bowels, so common in this country.</p>

of taking off the sheets and lying in the blankets, with all,
or most of his clothes on, will prevent all the danger. I have
practised this for many years, and never have been hurt by damp
beds, though no constitution, without care, is proof against their
baneful influence.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r56'>56</a>. People imagine if a good fire is made in a room after it has
been washed, that there is no danger from sitting in it; but they
must give me leave to say that this increases the danger. The

damp more active.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r57'>57</a>. The tap-rooms in London and other great towns, where
such numbers of people spend their evenings, are highly pernicious.
The breath of a number of people crowded into a low
apartment, with the addition of fires, candles, the smoke of tobacco,
and the fumes of hot liquor, &#38;c. must not only render it
hurtful to continue in such places, but dangerous to go out of
them into a cold and chilly atmosphere.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f58'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r58'>58</a>. Dr. Lind says, that twenty or twenty-five drops of laudanum
put into a cup of the patient’s drink, and given about half an
hour after the commencement of the hot fit, promotes the sweat,
shortens the fit, relieves the head, and tends greatly to remove the
disease.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f59'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r59'>59</a>. It has lately been observed, that the red bark is more powerful
than that which has for some time been in common use. Its superior
efficacy seems to arise from its being of a more perfect growth
than the quill bark, and consequently more fully impregnated
with the medical properties of the plant.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f60'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r60'>60</a>. In intermitting fevers of an obstinate nature, I have found
it necessary to throw in the bark much faster. Indeed the benefits
arising from this medicine depend chiefly upon a large quantity
of it being administered in a short time. Several ounces of
bark given in a few days will do more than as many pounds
taken in the course of some weeks. When this medicine is intended
either to stop a mortification, or cure an obstinate ague,
it ought to be thrown in as fast as the stomach can possibly bear
it. Inattention to this circumstance has hurt the reputation of
one of the best medicines of which we are in possession.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f61'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r61'>61</a>. There is reason to believe, that sundry of our own plants or
barks, which are very bitter and astringent, would succeed in the
cure of intermittent fevers, especially when assisted by aromatics.
But as the Peruvian bark has been long approved in the cure of
this disease, and is now to be obtained at a very reasonable rate,
it is of less importance to search after new medicines. We cannot
however omit taking notice, that the Peruvian bark is very often
adulterated, and that it requires considerable skill to distinguish
between the genuine and the false. This ought to make people
very cautious of whom they purchase it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f62'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r62'>62</a>. In obstinate agues, when the patient is old, the habit phlegmatic,
the season rainy, the situation damp, or the like, it will be
necessary to mix with two ounces of the bark, half an ounce of
Virginian snake-root, and a quarter of an ounce of ginger, or some
other warm aromatic; but when the symptoms are of an inflammatory
nature, half an ounce of salt of wormwood or salt of
tartar may be added to the above quantity of bark.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f63'>

would arise from sailing. The one is, that physicians seldom

they seldom order a voyage of a sufficient length. A patient may
receive no benefit by crossing the channel, who, should he cross
the Atlantic, might be completely cured. Indeed we have reason

with a little of the cordial confection or syrup of saffron. One
of these may be taken every four or five hours.</p>

<p class='c008'>The following powder may be used with the same intention:

two drachms, saffron one drachm. Let all of them be powdered,
and infused in an English pint of the best brandy for three or four
days. Afterwards the liquor may be strained, and two tea-spoonfuls

cautions should prevent people from attending their friends or
relations when afflicted with putrid fevers. I told him I meant
only to discourage unnecessary attendance, and mentioned a
number of instances where putrid fevers had proved fatal to
persons, who were rather hurtful than beneficial to the sick.
This sagacious physician agreed with me, in thinking that a good
doctor and a careful nurse were the only necessary attendants;
and that all others not only endangered themselves, but generally,
by their solicitude and ill-directed care, hurt the sick.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f85'>

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f86'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r86'>86</a>. In the <i>commercium literarium</i> for the year 1735, we have the
history of an epidemical miliary fever, which raged at Strasburgh
in the months of November, December, and January; from
which we learn the necessity of a temperate regimen in this malady,
and likewise that physicians are not always the first who
discover the proper treatment of diseases. “This fever made
terrible havock even among men of robust constitutions, and all
medicine proved in vain. They were seized in an instant with
shivering, yawning, stretching, and pains in the back, succeeded
by a most intense heat; at the same time there was a great loss
of strength and appetite. On the seventh or ninth day the miliary
eruptions appeared, or spots like flea-bites, with great anxiety,
a delirium, restlessness, and tossing in bed. Bleeding was fatal.
While matters were in this unhappy situation, a midwife, of her
own accord, gave to a patient, in the height of the disease, a
clyster of rain-water and butter without salt, and for his ordinary
drink a quart of spring water, half a pint of generous wine, the
juice of a lemon, and six ounces of the whitest sugar, gently boiled
till a scum arose, and this with great success; for the belly was
soon loosened, the grievous symptoms vanished, and the patient
was restored to his senses, and snatched from the jaws of death.”
This practice was imitated by others with the like happy effects.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f87'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r87'>87</a>. The ingenious Dr. Lind, of Edinburgh, in his inaugural dissertation
concerning the putrid remitting fever of Bengal, has
the following observation: “Indusia, lodices, ac stragula, sæpius
sunt mutanda, ac aëri exponenda; fœces sordesque quam primum
removendæ; oportet etiam ut loca quibus ægri decumbunt sint
salubria, et aceto conspersa; denique ut ægris cura quanta maxima
prospiciatur. Compertum ego habeo, medicum hæc fedulo
observantem, quique ea exequi potest, multo magis ægris profuturum,
quam medicum peritiorem hisce commodis destitutum.”</p>

<p class='c008'>“The patient’s shirt, bed-clothes, and bedding, ought frequently
to be changed, and exposed to the air, and all his excrements
immediately removed; the bed-chamber should be well
ventilated, and frequently sprinkled with vinegar; in short, every
attention should be paid to the patient. I can affirm, that a physician
who puts these in practice will much oftener succeed than
one who is even more skilful, but has not opportunity of using
these means.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f88'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r88'>88</a>. Convulsion-fits are no doubt very alarming, but their effects
are often salutary. They seem to be one of the means made use
of by Nature for breaking the force of a fever. I have always
observed the fever abated, and sometimes quite removed, after
one or more convulsion-fits. This readily accounts for convulsions
being a favourable symptom in the fever which precedes the
eruption of the small-pox, as every thing that mitigates this
fever lessens the eruption.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f89'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r89'>89</a>. I have known a nurse, who had the small-pox before, so infected
by lying constantly a-bed with a child in a bad kind of
small-pox, that she had not only a great number of pustules
which broke out all over her body, but afterwards a malignant
fever, which terminated in a number of imposthumes or boils,
and from which she narrowly escaped with her life. We mention
this to put others upon their guard against the danger of this
virulent infection.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f90'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r90'>90</a>. This observation is likewise applicable to hospitals, workhouses,
&#38;c. where numbers of children happen to have the small-pox
at the same time. I have seen above forty children cooped
up in one apartment all the while they had this disease, without
any of them being admitted to breathe the fresh air. No one
can be at a loss to see the impropriety of such conduct. It ought
to be a rule, not only in hospitals for the small-pox, but likewise
for other diseases, that no patient should be within sight or
hearing of another. This is a matter to which too little regard
is paid. In most hospitals and infirmaries, the sick, the dying,
and the dead, are often to be seen in the same apartment.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f91'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r91'>91</a>. Though this operation can never do harm, yet it is only
necessary when the patient has a great load of small-pox, or
when the matter which they contain is of so thin and acrid a nature,
that there is reason to apprehend bad consequences from its
being too quickly resorbed, or taken up again into the mass of
circulating humours.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f92'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r92'>92</a>. I have of late been accustomed, after the small-pox, to
give one, two, three, four, or five grains of calomel, according
to the age of the patient, over night, and to work it off next
morning with a suitable dose of jalap.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f93'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r93'>93</a>. A critical situation, too often to be met with, first put me
upon trying this method. A gentleman who had lost all his
children except one son by the natural small-pox, was determined
to have him inoculated. He told me his intention, and desired
I would persuade the mother and grandmother, &#38;c. of its propriety.
But that was impossible. They were not to be persuaded,
and either could not get the better of their fears, or
were determined against conviction. It was always a point with
me not to perform the operation without the consent of the
parties concerned. I therefore advised the father, after giving
his son a dose or two of rhubarb, to go to a patient who had the
small-pox of a good kind, to open two or three of the pustules,
taking up the matter with a little cotton, and as soon as he came
home to take his son apart, and give his arm a slight scratch
with a pin, afterwards to rub the place well with the cotton, and
take no farther notice of it. All this he punctually performed;
and at the usual period the small-pox made their appearance,
which were of an exceeding good kind, and so mild as not to
confine the boy an hour to his bed. None of the other relations
knew but the disease had come in the natural way, till the boy
was well.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f94'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r94'>94</a>. Mr. <span class='sc'>Tronchin</span> communicates this disease by a little bit of
thread dipt in the matter, which he covers with a small blistering-plaster.
This method may no doubt be used with advantage in
those cases where the patient is very much alarmed at the sight of
any cutting instrument.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f95'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r95'>95</a>. “Many and great,” says this humane author, “are the dangers
attending the natural infection, from all which the inoculation is
quite secure. The natural infection may invade weaker distempered
bodies, by no means disposed for its kindly reception. It
may attack them at a season of the year either violently hot or
intensely cold. It may be communicated from a sort of small-pox
impregnated with the utmost virulence. It may lay hold upon
people unexpectedly, when a dangerous sort is imprudently imported
into a maritime place. It may surprise us soon after
excesses committed in luxury, intemperance, or lewdness. It may
likewise seize on the innocent after indispensably watchings, hard
labour, or necessary journies. And is it a trivial advantage, that
all these unhappy circumstances can be prevented by inoculation?
By inoculation numbers are saved from deformity as well as from
death. In the natural small-pox, how often are the finest features,
and the most beautiful complexions, miserably disfigured? Whereas
inoculation rarely leaves any ugly marks of scars, even where the
number of pustules on the face has been very considerable, and
the symptoms by no means favourable. And many other grievous
complaints, that are frequently subsequent to the natural sort,
seldom follow the artificial. Does not inoculation also prevent
those inexpressible terrors that perpetually harass persons who never
had this disease, insomuch that when the small-pox is epidemical,
entire villages are depopulated, markets ruined, and the
face of distress spread over the whole country? From this terror
it arises, that justice is frequently postponed, or discouraged, at
sessions or assizes where the small-pox rages. Witnesses and
juries dare not appear; and by reason of the necessary absence of
some gentlemen, our honourable and useful judges are not attended
with that reverence and splendour due to their office and
merit. Does not inoculation, in like manner, prevent our brave
sailors from being seized with this distemper on shipboard, where
they must quickly spread the infection among such of the crew
who never had it before, and where they have scarce any chance
to escape, being half stifled with the closeness of their cabins,
and but very indifferently nursed? Lastly, with regard to the
soldiery, the miseries attending these poor creatures, when attacked
by the small-pox on a march, are inconceivable, without
attendance, without lodgings, without any accommodation; so
that one of three commonly perishes.”</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f96'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r96'>96</a>. By a well-laid plan for extending inoculation, more lives
might be saved at a small expence, than are at present preserved
by all the hospitals in England, which cost the public such an
amazing sum.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r97'>97</a>. I do not know any disease wherein bleeding is more necessary
than in the measles, especially when the fever runs high: in
this case I have always found it relieve the patient.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f98'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r98'>98</a>. Attempts have been made to communicate the measles, as
well as the small-pox, by inoculation, and we make no doubt
but in time the practice may succeed. Dr. Home of Edinburgh
says, he communicated the disease by the blood. Others have
tried this method, and have not found it succeed. Some think
the disease would be more certainly communicated by rubbing
the skin of a patient who has the measles with cotton, and afterwards
applying the cotton to a wound, as in the small-pox;
while others recommend a bit of flannel which had been applied
to the patient’s skin, all the time of the disease, to be afterwards
laid upon the arm or leg of the person to whom the infection is
to be communicated. There is no doubt but this disease, as well
as the small-pox, may be communicated various ways; the most
probable, however, is either from cotton rubbed upon the skin,
as mentioned above, or by introducing a little of the sharp humour
which distils from the eyes of the patient into the blood.
It is agreed on all hands, that such patients as have been inoculated
had the disease very mildly; we therefore wish the practice
were more general, as the measles have of late become very
fatal.</p>

fever prevailed in Edinburgh. It raged chiefly among young
people. The eruption was generally accompanied with a quinsey,
and the inflammatory symptoms were so blended with others
of a putrid nature, as to render the treatment of the disease very
difficult. Many of the patients, towards the decline of the fever,
were afflicted with large swellings of the submaxillary glands, and
not a few had a suppuration in one or both ears.</p>

a <i>blast</i>, and imagine it proceeds from foul air, or ill wind, as
they term it. The truth is, they often lie down to rest them,
when warm and fatigued, upon the damp ground, where they
fall asleep, and lie so long as to catch cold, which occasions the
erysipelas. This disease may indeed proceed from other causes,
but we may venture to say, that nine times out of ten it is occasioned
by cold caught after the body has been greatly heated or
fatigued.</p>

elixir of the Edinburgh Dispensatory, instead of the common
alkaline spirit. I have since been told by several practitioners,
that they found it to be an excellent medicine in this disorder,
and every way deserving of the character which I had given it.
Where this elixir is not kept, its place may be supplied by adding
to the common oily emulsion, an adequate proportion of the

others find difficulty in keeping it on. This proceeds from the
different kinds of pitch made use of, and likewise from the manner

hard, transparent pitch answers the purpose best.</p>

is on the decline; but there seems to be no sufficient reason for
this opinion, as patients have been known to reap benefit from a

take the patient out daily in a carriage. This seldom answers
any good purpose; but often does hurt, by giving him cold.</p>

alleviated even by the first dose. The dose for a child of
one year old, is a quarter of a grain dissolved in a cup of any
liquid, repeated two or three times a-day. For a child of two
years the dose is half a grain; and the quantity must be thus increased
in proportion to the age of the patient.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f126'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r126'>126</a>. The manner of making this broth is, to take a sheep’s head
and feet with the skin upon them, and to burn the wool off with
a hot iron; afterwards to boil them till the broth is quite a jelly.
A little cinnamon or mace may be added, to give the broth an
agreeable flavour, and the patient may take a little of it warm
with toasted bread three or four times a-day. A clyster of it
may likewise be given twice a-day. Such as cannot use the broth
made in this way, may have the head and feet skinned; but we
have reason to believe that this hurts the medicine. It is not our
business here to reason upon the nature and qualities of medicine,
otherwise this might be shewn to possess virtues every way suited
to the cure of a dysentery which does not proceed from a putrid
state of the humours. One thing we know, which is preferable
to all reasoning, that whole families have often been cured by it,
after they had used many other medicines in vain. It will, however,
be proper that the patient take a vomit, and a dose or two
of rhubarb, before he begins to use the broth. It will likewise
be necessary to continue the use of it for a considerable time, and
to make it the principal food.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f127'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r127'>127</a>. The learned and humane Dr. Rutherford, late professor of
medicine in the university of Edinburgh, used to mention this
food in his public lectures with great encomiums. He directed it
to be made by tying a pound or two of the finest flour, as tight as
possible, in a linen rag, afterwards to dip it frequently in water,
and to dredge the outside with flour, till a cake or crust was
formed around it, which prevents the water from soaking into it
while boiling. It is then to be boiled till it becomes a hard dry
mass, as directed above. This, when mixed with milk and water,
will not only answer the purpose of food, but may likewise
be given in clysters.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f128'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r128'>128</a>. I lately saw a young man who had been seized with a dysentery
in North America. Many things had been tried there for his
relief, but to no purpose. At length, tired out with disappointments
from medicine, and reduced to skin and bone, he came over
to Britain, rather with a view to die among his relations, than with
any hopes of a cure. After taking sundry medicines here with
no better success than abroad, I advised him to leave off the use
of drugs, and to trust entirely to a diet of milk and fruits, with
gentle exercise. Strawberries was the only fruit he could procure
at that season. These he ate with milk twice, and sometimes
thrice a-day. The consequence was, that in a short time his stools
were reduced from upwards of twenty in a-day, to three or four,
and sometimes not so many. He used the other fruits as they
came in, and was in a few weeks so well as to leave that part of
the country where I was, with a view to return to America.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r134'>134</a>. That worms exist in the human body there can be no doubt;
and that they must sometimes be considered as a disease, is
equally certain: but this is not the case so often as people
imagine. The idea that worms occasion many diseases, gives an
opportunity to the professed worm-doctors of imposing on the
credulity of mankind, and doing much mischief. They find
worms in every case, and liberally throw in their antidotes,
which generally consist of strong, drastic purges. I have known
these given in delicate constitutions to the destruction of the patient,
where there was not the least symptom of worms.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f135'>

<div class='footnote' id='f137'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r137'>137</a>. We think it necessary here to warn people of their danger
who buy cakes, powders, and other worm medicines, at random
from quacks, and give them to their children without proper
care. The principal ingredients in most of these medicines is
mercury, which is never to be trifled with. I lately saw a
shocking instance of the danger of this conduct. A girl who
had taken a dose of worm powder, bought of a travelling quack,
went out, and perhaps was so imprudent as to drink cold water
during its operation. She immediately swelled, and died on
the following day, with all the symptoms of having been poisoned.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f138'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r138'>138</a>. The very name of an operation is dreadful to most people,
and they wish to try every thing before they have recourse to it.
This is the reason why tapping so seldom succeeds to our wish. I
have had a patient who was regularly tapped once a month for
several years, and who used to eat her dinner as well after the
operation as if nothing had happened. She died at last rather
worn out by age than by the disease.</p>

sort of peasants in Scotland, and among the manufacturers in
England. These are not only sufficient to keep the seeds of the
disease alive, but to spread the infection among others. It were
to be wished that some effectual method could be devised for extirpating
it altogether. Several country clergymen have told
me, that by getting such as were infected cured, and strongly recommending
an attention to cleanliness, they have banished the
itch entirely out of their parishes. Why might not others do
the same?</p>

To four or five ounces of the solution of gum-ammoniac add two

low, and was exceeding slow. By bleeding, blistering, and other
evacuations, she was kept alive for about a fortnight. When
her head was opened, a large quantity of extravasated blood was

<div class='footnote' id='f146'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r146'>146</a>. The learned Dr. Arbuthnot advises those who are troubled
with costiveness to use animal oils, as fresh butter, cream, marrow,
fat broths, especially those made of the internal parts of
animals, as the liver, heart, midriff, &#38;c. He likewise recommends
the expressed oils of mild vegetables, as olives, almonds,
pastaches, and the fruits themselves; all oily and mild fruits, as
figs; decoctions of mealy vegetables; these lubricate the intestines;
some saponaceous substances which stimulate gently, as
honey, hydromel, or boiled honey and water, unrefined sugar,
&#38;c.</p>

<p class='c008'>The Doctor observes, that such lenitive substances are proper
for persons of dry atrabilarian constitutions, who are subject to
astriction of the belly, and the piles, and will operate when
stronger medicinal substances are sometimes ineffectual; but that
such lenitive diet hurts those whose bowels are weak and lax. He
likewise observes, that all watery substances are lenitive, and
that even common water, whey, sour milk, and butter-milk,
have that effect;—That new milk, especially asses milk, stimulates
still more when it sours on the stomach; and that whey
turned sour will purge strongly;—That most garden fruits are
likewise laxative; and that some of them, as grapes, will throw
such as take them immoderately into a cholera morbus, or incurable
diarrhœa.</p>

nerves, and that drinking the same quantity of warm water
would be equally pernicious. This however seems to be a mistake.
Many persons drink three or four cups of warm milk and
water daily, without feeling any bad consequences; yet the same
quantity of tea will make their hands shake for twenty-four
hours. That tea affects the nerves, is likewise evident from its
preventing sleep, occasioning giddiness, dimness of the sight,

cured by exciting an opposite passion. This is said to have been
the case of a whole school of young ladies in Holland, who were
all cured by being told, that the first who was seized should be
burnt to death. But this method of cure, to my knowledge, will
not always succeed. I would therefore advise, that young ladies
who are subject to hysteric fits should not be sent to boarding
schools, as the disease may be caught by imitation. I have

There are many employments of which blind persons are

such persons may be taught not only to read and write, but also to
speak, and to understand what others say to them. Teaching the
dumb to speak will appear paradoxical to those who do not consider
that the formation of sounds is merely mechanical, and may
be taught without the assistance of the ear. This is not only capable
of demonstration, but is actually reduced to practice by the
ingenious Mr. Thomas Braidwood of Edinburgh. This gentleman
has, by the mere force of genius and application, brought
the teaching of dumb persons to such a degree of perfection, that
his scholars are generally more forward in their education than
those of the same age who enjoy all their faculties. They not
only read and write with the utmost readiness, but likewise <i>speak</i>,
and are capable of holding conversation with any person in the
light. What a pity any of the human species should remain in a
state of idiotism, who are capable of being rendered as useful and
intelligent as others! We mention this not only from humanity
to those who have the misfortune to be born deaf, but also in
justice to Mr. Braidwood, whose success has far exceeded all
former attempts this way; and indeed it exceeds imagination itself
so far, that no person who has not seen and examined his
pupils, can believe what they are capable of.—As this gentleman,
however willing, is only able to teach a few, and as the
far greater part of those who are born deaf cannot afford to
attend him, it would be an act of great humanity, as well as
of public utility, to erect an academy for their benefit.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r157'>157</a>. A gentleman, on whose veracity I can depend, told me, that
after using many things to no purpose for an obstinate deafness,
he was at last advised to put a few drops of his own urine warm
into his ears every night and morning, from which he received
great benefit. It is probable that a solution of <i>sal ammoniac</i>, in
water, would produce the same effect.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r159'>159</a>. In a cancer which had set all medicines, and even surgery,
at defiance, I lately saw remarkable effects from an obstinate
perseverance in a course of antiseptics. I ordered the deep
ulcers to be washed to the bottom by means of a syringe, twice
or thrice a-day, either with an infusion of the bark, or a decoction
of carrot, and that the patient should take four or five
times a-day, a glass of good wine, with half a drachm of the
best powdered bark in it. The sores, after being washed, were
likewise sprinkled with the same powder. When the patient
began this course, her death was daily expected. She continued
it for above two years, with manifest advantage; but being told
by an eminent surgeon, that the bark would not cure a cancer,
and that the sores ought not to be washed, she discontinued the
practice, and died in a few weeks. This course was not expected
to cure the cancer, but to prolong the patient’s life, which it evidently
did almost to a miracle.</p>

disease, we would have given some directions for the gathering

yet we would not advise any person, who has reason to believe

been no great philosopher, and was some times the dupe of his
own credulity.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f162'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r162'>162</a>. The Ormskirk medicine, as it is called, seems to me to consist
chiefly of cinnabar. Though it is said to be infallible, as a
preventive; yet I would not advise any one to trust to it alone.
Indeed it is ordered to be taken in a manner which gives it more
the appearance of a charm than of a medicine. Surely if a medicine
is to produce any change in the body, it must be taken for
some considerable time, and in sufficient quantity.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f163'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r163'>163</a>. The practice of sucking out poisons is very ancient; and indeed
nothing can be more rational. Where the bite cannot be
cut out, this is the most likely way for extracting the poison.
There can be no danger in performing this office, as the poison
does no harm unless it be taken into the body by a wound. The
person who sucks the wound ought however to wash his mouth
frequently with salad-oil, which will secure him from even the
least inconveniency. The <i>Psylli</i> in Africa, and the <i>Marsi</i> in
Italy, were famed for curing the bites of poisonous animals by
sucking the wound; and we are told, that the Indians in North
America practise the same at this day.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r164'>164</a>. Although it is now very common to cure the gonorrhœa by
astringent injections, there are still many practitioners who do
not approve this mode of practice. I can, however, from much
experience, assert, that it is both the most easy, elegant, and efficacious
method of cure; and that any bad consequences arising
from it must be owing to the ignorance or misconduct of the practitioner
himself, and not to the remedy. Many, for example,
use strong preparations of lead, all of which are dangerous when
applied to the internal surfaces of the body; others use escharotics,
which inflame and injure the parts. I have known a gonorrhœa
actually cured by an injection made of green tea, and
would always recommend gentle methods where they will succeed.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f165'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r165'>165</a>. If the patient can swallow a solution of salts and manna, he
may take six drachms, or, if his constitution requires it, an ounce
of the former, with half an ounce of the latter. These may be
dissolved in an English pint of boiling water, whey, or thin water-gruel,
and taken early in the morning.</p>

<p class='c008'>If an infusion of senna and tamarinds be more agreeable, two
drachms of the former, and an ounce of the latter, may be infused
all night in an English pint of boiling water. The infusion
may be strained next morning, and half an ounce of Glauber’s
salts dissolved in it. A tea-cupful of this infusion may be
taken every half hour till it operates.</p>

<p class='c008'>Should the patient prefer an electuary, the following will be
found to answer very well. Take of the lenitive electuary four
ounces, cream of tartar two ounces, jalap in powder two drachms,
rhubarb one drachm, and as much of the syrup of pale roses as
will serve to make up the whole into a soft electuary. Two or
three tea-spoonfuls of this may be taken over-night, and about
the same quantity next morning, every day that the patient
chuses to take a purge.</p>

<p class='c008'>The doses of the above medicines may be increased or diminished
according as the patient finds it necessary. We have ordered
the salts to be dissolved in a large quantity of water, because
it renders their operation more mild.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f166'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r166'>166</a>. Take quicksilver one drachm, gum-arabic reduced to a
mucilage two drachms; let the quicksilver be rubbed with the
mucilage, in a marble mortar, until the globules of mercury entirely
disappear; afterwards add gradually, still continuing the
trituration, half an ounce of balsamic syrup, and eight ounces
of simple cinnamon-water. Two table-spoonfuls of this solution
may be taken night and morning. Some reckon this the
best form in which quicksilver can be exhibited for the cure of
a gonorrhœa.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f167'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r167'>167</a>. The Peruvian bark may be combined with other astringents,
and prepared in the following manner:</p>

<p class='c008'>Take of Peruvian bark bruised six drachms, of fresh galls
bruised two drachms; boil them in a pound and a half of water
to a pound; to the strained liquor add three ounces of the simple
tincture of the bark. A small tea-cupful of this may be taken
three times a-day, adding to each cup fifteen or twenty drops
of the acid elixir of vitriol.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f168'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r168'>168</a>. Take Venice turpentine, boiled to a sufficient degree of
hardness, half an ounce, calomel half a drachm. Let these be
mixed and formed into sixty pills, of which five or six may be
taken night and morning. If, during the use of these pills, the
mouth should grow sore, or the breath become offensive, they
must be discontinued till these symptoms disappear.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f169'>

may be communicated by kissing. I have seen very obstinate venereal
ulcers in the lips, which I had all the reason in the world
to believe were communicated in this manner.</p>

<p class='c008'>Nurses ought to beware of suckling infected children, or having

</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f173'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r173'>173</a>. I have found it answer extremely well to sprinkle chancres
twice a-day with calomel. This will often perform a cure without
any other application whatever. If the chancres are upon the
<i>glans</i>, they may be washed with milk and water, a little warm,
and afterwards the calomel may be applied as above.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f174'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r174'>174</a>. The sublimate may be given in distilled water, or any other
liquor that the patient chuses. I commonly order ten grains to
be dissolved in an ounce of the spirit of wine, for the conveniency
of carriage, and let the patient take twenty or thirty drops of it
night and morning in half a glass of brandy or other spirits. Mr.
Debraw, an ingenious chymist of this place, informs me, that
he prepares a salt of mercury much more mild and gentle in its
operation than the sublimate, though equally efficacious.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f176'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r176'>176</a>. Though we are still very much in the dark with regard to
the method of curing this disease among the natives of America,
yet it is generally affirmed, that they do cure it with speed, safety,
and success, and that without the least knowledge of mercury.
Hence it becomes an object of considerable importance to discover
their method of cure. This might surely be done by
making trials of the various plants which are found in those
parts, and particularly of such as the natives are known to make
use of. All people in a rude state take their medicines chiefly
from the vegetable kingdom, and are often possessed of valuable
secrets with regard to the virtues of plants, of which more enlightened
nations are ignorant. Indeed we make no doubt but
some plants of our own growth, were proper pains taken to discover
them, would be found as efficacious in curing the venereal
disease as those of America. It must however be remembered,
that what will cure the venereal disease in one country, will not
always be found to have equal success in another.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f177'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r177'>177</a>. I have not only often seen a recent infection carried off in a
few days by means of cleanliness, viz. bathing, fomentations, injections,
&#38;c. but have likewise found it of the greatest advantage
in the more advanced stages of the disease. Of this I had lately
a very remarkable instance, in a man whose penis was almost
wholly consumed by venereal ulcers; the matter had been allowed
to continue on the sores, without any care having been
taken to clean them, till, notwithstanding the use of mercury
and other medicines, it had produced the effects above mentioned.
I ordered warm milk and water to be injected three or
four times a-day into all the sinuous ulcers, in order to wash out
the matter; after which they were stuffed with dry lint to absorb
the fresh matter as it was generated. The patient at the same
time took every day half a grain of the corrective sublimate of
mercury, dissolved in an ounce of brandy, and drank an English
quart of the decoction of sarsaparilla. By this treatment, in about
six weeks, he was perfectly cured; and, what was very remarkable,
a part of the penis was actually regenerated.</p>

<p class='c008'>Doctor Gilchrist has given an account of a species of the <i>lues
venerea</i> which prevails in the west of Scotland, to which the natives
give the name of <i>Sibbins</i> or <i>Sivvins</i>. The Doctor observes,
that the spreading of this disease is chiefly owing to a neglect of
cleanliness, and seems to think, that by due attention to that
<i>virtue</i>, it might be extirpated. The treatment of this disease is
similar to that of a confirmed lues or pox. The <i>yaws</i>, a disease
which is now very common both in America and the West India
islands, may also be cured in the same manner.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f178'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r178'>178</a>. It is the duty of mothers, and those who are intrusted with
the education of girls, to instruct them early in the conduct and
management of themselves at this critical period of their lives.
False modesty, inattention, and ignorance of what is beneficial or
hurtful at this time, are the sources of many diseases and misfortunes
in life, which a few sensible lessons from an experienced
matron might have prevented. Nor is care less necessary in the
subsequent returns of this discharge. Taking improper food,
violent affections of the mind, or catching cold at this period, is
often sufficient to ruin the health, or to render the female ever
after incapable of procreation.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f179'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r179'>179</a>. Two drachms of allum and one of Japan earth may be

table-spoonfuls of the tincture of roses three or four times a-day,
to each dose of which ten drops of laudanum may be added.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f180'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r180'>180</a>. Every mother who procures an abortion does it at the hazard
of her life; yet there are not a few who run this risk merely
to prevent the trouble of bearing and bringing up children. It
is surely a most unnatural crime, and cannot, even in the most
abandoned, be viewed without horror; but in the decent matron,
it is still more unpardonable.—Those wretches who daily
advertise their assistance to women in this business, deserve, in
my opinion, the most severe of all human punishments.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f181'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r181'>181</a>. Though the management of women in child-bed has been
practised as an employment since the earliest accounts of time;
yet it is still in most countries on a very bad footing. Few women
think of following this employment till they are reduced to
the necessity of doing it for bread. Hence not one in a hundred
of them have any education, or proper knowledge of their business.
It is true, that Nature, if left to herself, will generally
expel the <i>fœtus</i>; but it is equally true, that most women in
child-bed require to be managed with skill and attention, and
that they are often hurt by the superstitious prejudices of ignorant
and officious midwives. The mischief done in this way is
much greater than is generally imagined; most of which might
be prevented by allowing no women to practise midwifery but
such as are properly qualified. Were due attention paid to this,
it would not only be the means of saving many lives, but would
prevent the necessity of employing men in this indelicate and
disagreeable branch of medicine, which is, on many accounts,
more proper for the other sex.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f182'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r182'>182</a>. We cannot help taking notice of that ridiculous custom
which still prevails in some parts of the country, of collecting a
number of women together upon such occasions. These, instead
of being useful, serve only to crowd the house, and obstruct
the necessary attendants. Besides, they hurt the patient
with their noise; and often, by their untimely and impertinent
advice, do much mischief.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f183'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r183'>183</a>. In a violent flooding after delivery, I have seen very good
effects from the following mixture: Take of penny-royal water,
simple cinnamon-water, and syrup of poppies, each two ounces,
elixir of vitriol a drachm. Mix, and take two table-spoonfuls
every two hours, or oftner, if necessary.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f184'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r184'>184</a>. Take of crabs claws prepared half an ounce, purified nitre
two drachms, saffron powdered half a drachm; rub them together
in a mortar, and divide the whole into eight or nine doses.</p>

<p class='c008'>When the patient is low-spirited, or troubled with hysterical
complaints, she ought to take frequently twelve or fifteen drops
of the tincture of asafœtida in a cup of penny-royal tea.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f185'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r185'>185</a>. Midwives ought to be very cautious in administering vomits
or purges to women in child-bed. I have known a woman, who
was recovering extremely well, thrown into the most imminent
danger, by a strong purge which was given her by an officious
midwife.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f186'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r186'>186</a>. Dr. Cheyne avers, that want of children is oftner the fault
of the male than of the female, and strongly recommends a milk
and vegetable diet to the former as well as the latter; adding,
that his friend Dr. Taylor, whom he calls the Milk-doctor of
Croydon, had brought sundry opulent families in his neighbourhood,
who had continued some years after marriage without progeny,
to have several fine children, by keeping both parents, for
a considerable time, to a milk and vegetable diet.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f187'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r187'>187</a>. Of the officious and ill-judged care of midwives, we shall
adduce only one instance, viz. the common practice of torturing
infants by squeezing their breasts, to draw off the milk, as they
call it. Though a small quantity of moisture is generally found
in the breasts of infants, yet, as they are certainly not intended
to give suck, this ought never to be drawn off. I have seen this
cruel operation bring on hardness, inflammation, and suppuration
of the breasts; but never knew any ill consequences from its
being omitted. When the breasts are hard, the only application
that we would recommend is a soft poultice, or a little of the
diachylon plaster, spread thin upon a bit of soft leather, about
the size of half a crown, and applied over each nipple. These
may be suffered to continue till the hardness disappears.</p>

<div class='footnote' id='f189'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r189'>189</a>. Some nurses remove this complaint by sucking the child’s

the practice.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f190'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r190'>190</a>. I some time ago saw a very striking instance of the danger of
substituting drying medicines in the place of cleanliness and
wholesome food, in the Foundling Hospital at Ackworth, where
the children were grievously afflicted with scabbed heads and
other cutaneous disorders. Upon inquiry it was found, that
very little attention was paid either to the propriety or soundness
of their provisions, and that cleanliness was totally neglected;
accordingly it was advised that they should have more wholesome
food, and be kept thoroughly clean. This advice, however,
was not followed. It was too troublesome to the servants, superintendants,
&#38;c. The business was to be done by medicine;
which was accordingly attempted, but had nearly proved fatal
to the whole house. Fevers and other internal disorders immediately
appeared, and at length a putrid dysentery, which proved
so infectious, that it carried off a great many of the children,
and spread over a considerable part of the neighbouring
country.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f191'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r191'>191</a>. In this disease bleeding is not always proper; but in very
full habits it must certainly be of use.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f192'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r192'>192</a>. I was lately favoured with a letter from Dr. William Turnbull
in London, a physician of great experience, and who, from
his former situation on the north-east coast of England, had many
opportunities of observing the symptoms and progress of this
dangerous disease. I am sorry the letter came too late to be inserted
at length; but as the Doctor’s sentiments differ very little
from my own, this misfortune is the less to be regretted. The
Doctor indeed observes, that he never found blistering of any
service; but recommends cataplasms of garlic, camphor, and
Venice treacle, to be applied both to the throat and soles of the
feet. He likewise recommends boluses of camphor, castor, valerian
root, salt of hartshorn, and musk, adapted to the age,
strength, &#38;c. of the patient; after which he advises two spoonfuls
of the following decoction:—Take of garlic and distilled
vinegar each an ounce, hysop-water eight ounces; beat up the
ingredients together, gradually mixing the water, and adding
three ounces of honey. Let the whole be simmered over a gentle
fire, and afterwards drained for use.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f193'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r193'>193</a>. One reason why this disease is seldom or never cured, may
be, that it is seldom known till too far advanced to admit of
remedy. Did parents watch the first symptoms, and call a physician
in due time, I am inclined to think that something might
be done. But these symptoms are not yet sufficiently known,
and are often mistaken even by physicians themselves. Of this
I lately saw a striking instance in a patient attended by an eminent
practitioner of this city, who had all along mistaken the
disease for teething.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f194'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r194'>194</a>. Dr. Tissot, in his <cite>Advice to the People</cite>, gives the following
directions for gathering, preparing, and applying the agaric.—“Gather
in autumn,” says he, “while the fine weather lasts, the
agaric of the oak, which is a kind of fungus or excrescence issuing
from the wood of that tree. It consists at first of four parts,
which present themselves successively: 1. The outward rind or
skin, which may be thrown away. 2. The part immediately
under this rind, which is the best of all. This is to be beat well
with a hammer, till it becomes soft and very pliable. This is
the only preparation it requires, and a slice of it of a proper size
is to be applied directly over the bursting open blood vessels. It
constringes and brings them close together, stops the bleeding,
and generally falls off at the end of two days. 3. The third
part adhering to the second may serve to stop the bleeding from
the smaller vessels; and the fourth and last part may be reduced
to powder as conducing to the same purpose.”—Where the agaric
cannot be had, sponge may be used in its stead. It must be
applied in the same manner, and has nearly the same effects.</p>

would be of little use, I shall refer the reader to a cheap and
useful performance <i>on the nature and cure of fractures</i>, lately published
by my ingenious friend Mr. Aitken, surgeon in Edinburgh;
wherein that gentleman has not only given an account

<p class='c008'><a href='#r201'>201</a>. I would here beg leave to recommend it to every practitioner,
when his patient complains of pain in the belly with obstinate
costiveness, to examine the groins and every place where
a rupture may happen, in order that it may be immediately reduced.
By neglecting this, many perish who were not suspected
to have had ruptures till after they were dead. I have known
this happen where half a dozen of the faculty were in attendance.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f202'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r202'>202</a>. A woman in one of the hospitals of this city lately discharged
a great number of pins, which she had swallowed in the
course of her business, through an ulcer in her side.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f203'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r203'>203</a>. These accidents are not always the effects of carelessness. I
have known an infant overlaid by its mother being seized in
the night with an hysteric fit. This ought to serve as a caution
against employing hysteric women as nurses; and should likewise
teach such women never to lay an infant in the same bed with
themselves, but in a small adjacent one.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f204'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r204'>204</a>. The Author is happy to observe, that, since the first publication
of this work, several societies have been instituted in Britain
with the same benevolent intention as that of Amsterdam,
and that their endeavours have proved no less successful. He is
likewise happy to observe, that premiums have been awarded
to those who have been active in their endeavours to restore to
life persons who had been drowned, or suddenly deprived of life
by any accident. How much is this superior to the superstitious
institution, which allows any man a premium who brings a dead
person out of the water, so that he may receive Christian burial;
but allows nothing to the person who brings him out alive, or
who recovers him after he has been to all appearance dead.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f205'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r205'>205</a>. The late celebrated Dr. Smollet has indeed said, that if he
were persuaded he had an ulcer in the lungs, he would jump
into the cold bath: but here the Doctor evidently shews more
courage than discretion; and that he was more a man of wit
than a physician, every one will allow. A nervous asthma, or an
atrophy, may be mistaken for a pulmonary consumption; yet, in
the two former, the cold bath proves often beneficial, though I
never knew it to in the latter. Indeed, all the phthisical patients
I ever saw, who had tried the cold bath, were evidently
hurt by it.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f206'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r206'>206</a>. The celebrated Galen says, that immersion in cold water is
fit only for the young of lions and bears; and recommends warm
bathing, as conducive to the growth and strength of infants.
How egregiously do the greatest men err whenever they lose sight
of facts, and substitute reasoning in physic in place of observation
and experience!</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f207'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r207'>207</a>. The greatest class of mineral waters in this country is the
chalybeate. In many parts of Britain these are to be found in
almost every field; but those chiefly in use, for medical purposes,
are the purging chalybeates, as the waters of Scarborough,
Cheltenham, Thorp Arch, Nevil Holt, &#38;c. Of those which do
not purge, the waters of Tunbridge stand in the highest repute.
The saline purging waters, as those of Acton, Epsom, Kilburn,
&#38;c. are also in very general esteem; but the fountains
most frequented by the sick in this country, are those to which
the minerals impart a certain degree of heat, as Bath, Bristol,
Buxton, &#38;c.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote' id='f208'>
<p class='c008'><a href='#r208'>208</a>. When I speak of drinking a glass of the water over-night,
I must beg leave to caution those who follow this plan against
eating heavy suppers. The late Dr. Daultry of York, who was
the first that brought the Harrowgate waters into repute, used
to advise his patients to drink a glass before they went to bed;
the consequence of which was, that having eat a flesh supper,
and the water operating in the night, they were often tormented
with gripes, and obliged to call for medical assistance.</p>

Literary Essays, by the ingenious Dr. John Gardener.</p>

<p class='c008'><a href='#r210'>210</a>. A very good tincture of guaiacum, for domestic use, may
be made by infusing two or three ounces of the gum in a bottle of
rum or brandy.</p>
